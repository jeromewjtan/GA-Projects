'Twas the night before Christmas and Santa's a wreck...
How to live in a world that's politically correct?

His workers no longer would answer to ""Elves,""
""Vertically Challenged"" they were calling themselves.

And labour conditions at the north pole
Were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.

Four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety,
Released to the wilds by the Humane Society.

And equal employment had made it quite clear
That Santa had better not use just reindeer.

So Dancer and Donner, Comet and Cupid,
Were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!

The runners had been removed from his sleigh;
The ruts were termed dangerous by the E.P.A.

And people had started to call for the cops
When they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.

Second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened.
His fur-trimmed red suit was called ""Unenlightened.""

And to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows,
Rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose

And had gone on Geraldo, in front of the nation,
Demanding millions in over-due compensation.

So, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife,
Who suddenly said she'd enough of this life,

Joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz,
Demanding from now on her title was Ms.

And as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion
That making a choice could cause so much commotion.

Nothing of leather, nothing of fur,
Which meant nothing for him. And nothing for her.

Nothing that might be construed to pollute.
Nothing to aim. Nothing to shoot.

Nothing that clamoured or made lots of noise.
Nothing for just girls. Or just for the boys.

Nothing that claimed to be gender specific.
Nothing that's warlike or non-pacific.

No candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth.
Nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.

And fairy tales, while not yet forbidden,
Were like Ken and Barbie, better off hidden.

For they raised the hackles of those psychological
Who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.

No baseball, no football...someone could get hurt;
Besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.

Dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe;
And Nintendo would rot your entire brain away.

So Santa just stood there, dishevelled, perplexed;
He just could not figure out what to do next.

He tried to be merry, tried to be gay,
But you've got to be careful with that word today.

His sack was quite empty, limp to the ground;
Nothing fully acceptable was to be found.

Something special was needed, a gift that he might
Give to all without angering the left or the right.

A gift that would satisfy, with no indecision,
Each group of people, every religion;

Every ethnicity, every hue,
Everyone, everywhere...even you.

So here is that gift, its price beyond worth...
""May you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth.""

364,So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living,"
He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.
 
Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""You know what? No,"" said the executioner. ""I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.

The man looked at the executioner and said, ""Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor.""",Jokes

“Ah, my letter.  Thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  Please do so again” replies the Buddhist monk.

“But sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

471,THE COFFIN,"A man is walking home alone late one foggy Halloween night, when behind him he hears: 
BUMP... BUMP... BUMP... 
Walking faster, he looks back and through the fog he makes out the image of an upright casket banging its way down the middle of the street toward him. 

BUMP... BUMP... BUMP... 

Terrified, the man begins to run toward his home, the casket bouncing quickly behind him. 
FASTER... FASTER... BUMP... BUMP... BUMP.... 
He runs up to his door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door, rushes in, slams and locks the door behind him. However, the casket crashes through his door, with the lid of the casket clapping. 

clappity-BUMP...clappity-BUMP... clappity-BUMP...

on his heels, as the terrified man runs. 

Rushing upstairs to the bathroom, he locks himself in. His heart is pounding; his head is reeling; his breath is coming in sobbing gasps. 

With a loud CRASH the casket breaks down the door. 
Bumping and clapping toward him. 
The man screams and reaches for something, anything...

All he can find is a box of cough drops! Desperate, he throws the cough drops at the coffin ...

A personal example of how I do this is with my own health. I’ve had the digestive problem IBS since I was a teenager. It’s not the easiest thing in the world to live with sometimes. Medication makes a big difference though. .... 
So anyway one day when I was dealing with this stuff I got the idea to make a joke out of it. ....


If you don’t have IBS, I’m gonna explain to you exactly what it is so you understand. This is probably the most accurate way I can think of to describe it....


.....


If you’re someone who suffers from IBS, you understand that there is a much more literal meaning to the phrase “rip a new a**hole.” 


.....


When you have an IBS episode, you suddenly realize that you’re not too different from a volcano!


.....


When you have IBS, the most offensive thing someone can say to you is “sh*t happens.” You take that phrase literally.


.....


If you have IBS, you know that eating at Taco Bell will probably kill you.


.....


If you have IBS, you probably have some idea of what labor pains are like.


.....


If you have IBS, you get a daily adrenaline rush of having to run full speed to the bathroom and get your pants off in time!... It’s like a pit stop in a NASCAR race. You gotta time everything just right or your day is ruined.


.....


If you have IBS, you know what the ground under a nuclear detonation feels like. It’s one heck of an explosion.


.....


When you have IBS, you know what it’s like to walk like a duck for a short period of time every morning.


.....


If you have IBS, you probably know what it’s like to do squat exercises over a pit of molten lava.


.....


If you have IBS, you know how embarrassing it is to have your legs fall asleep on the toilet. ..... You get up afterwards and you about fall straight forward into the wall in front of you.


.....


If you have IBS, you know what undigested, flaming Chipotle feels like.


.....


If you have IBS, you know what it’s like to light a firecracker in your a**.


.....


If you have IBS, you often find yourself sprinting to the bathroom while yelling “Run for your lives! Krakatoa’s about to erupt!”


.....


Hopefully y’all have an understanding of what irritable bowel syndrome is now.",Jokes

614,A man and his son run a carpentry business out in the countryside…,"They do small jobs here and there, mostly on farms and ranches, fixing up barns and building pens for farm animals. The father eventually wants his son to take over the business and has tried to teach him the ins and outs of woodworking, along with other important lessons he thinks that every carpenter should know.

“The most m’portant thang,” the father always reminds his son in his heavy country accent, “is to know yer tools and ta make sure ev’ry tool has a place.”

True to his statement, the father has his tools in immaculate order. Each one has its place and he even has each tool labeled so that it’s easy to find and can be returned to the proper place when it is not in use. Over the years, he has perfected his labeling system and can name a tool just by reading the double-lettered code he has assigned to it.

One day when the two had the day off, the carpenter’s wife asks them to fix the squeaky floor boards on the front porch.  The man sees this as a perfect opportunity to test his son to see what he’s learned, so he lets him take the lead on the job.

“A’right son.” The man said, “First thangs first, we needa pull up these here nails, then measure n’ cut some wood fer the new floor boards. Why don’t ya run to the back n’ grab the tools you think’ll do the job?”

So, the son goes to the tool shed behind the house and brings back a hammer, measuring tape, and a saw with a rather dull blade. He hands his father the tools one by one as the carpenter examines them and evaluates his son’s decisions.

“Ah, hammer B-F. That’s a good’un. And measuring tape G-C is the right tool fer sure.”

But as his son hands him the saw, the carpenter sees the dull blade and shakes his head in disappointment.

“Dangit boy,” the father says, trying to hold back his anger. “I-A i’nt the sharpest tool in the shed!”",Jokes

652,Bit of a long one but I hope you guys enjoy,"So there's this crazed killer who got arrested by the cops named Yu Gwong. Now Gwong was a crazy SOB. Gwong would cut people's genitals off and glue em to his own missing parts. Everyone was scared of this guy but unfortunately due to the fact that the legal system is flawed he gets an insanity plea and is put in a mental hospital.

Gary has been working at this exact hospital for about 5 years. Mostly he deals with schizos, suicidal folks, and a group of people who think they are someone else. 

These people would usually switch personalities every few weeks based on what movies were out. During the 90s they were skaters, ww2 soldiers, and then Neo from the Matrix.

Gary personally gets creeped out by the crowd and is known for calling them in a lot and getting the whole guard unit to tackle em and send em to their rooms. They don't seem to mind too much and it keeps Gary sane.

So anyway Gwong is transferred in to this facility and he gets put in Gary's ward. Gary is terrified. Everywhere he goes he's wigging out, worried his dick is gonna get glued to Gwong's pelvis and flop around while he bleeds out on the floor. Luckily the only time of day that Gwong is free from a straight jacket is during lunch time. Gwong goes around and does his best to make friends but everyone else is afraid of this guy on account of the dick cutting. Well Gwong finds a table, its the group who changes personalities who currently are Thanos from Avengers.

Gwong sits and chats with them about anger, genocide, and hating society. Eventually he mentions the new movie The Joker to them and how a whole crowd of people dressed as clowns to show solidarity with the chatacter. Gwong starts thinking he has a solid plan to bust out by utilizing these weirdies but instead a ruckuss rises from the group. 3 guys claim they are the Joker and the rest of the crowd has painted their face white with their mashed potatos.

Gary sees what's going on and who is causing it and starts to panic thinking that Gwong is gonna start a riot and escape. Gary's mind flashes to the mental image of his dick swaying in the wind on Gwong's groin. 

Gary starts seperating the group into two sides, not noticing Gwong behind him. After clearing em out on to opposite sides of the room he turns around to see Gwong, knife in hand, smiling. 

Gary's final words over the radio were ""I got clowns to the left of me, Jokers to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle the Yu.""",Jokes

She responds, ""Yes, the only one to exist!"" With a shocked look he asked, ""Can I go see it?"" She says, ""Of course! That'll be $10 but there is one rule. Do not touch the gorilla no matter what."" So the guy pays the $10 and walks in the doors. He sees a sign next to a staircase that says, 'The Amazing Purple Gorilla downstairs. CAUTION: DO NOT TOUCH!' He walks down the stairs and there it is. A purple gorilla but it's back is turned towards him. Still, he was shocked. ""Wow!"" There was a purple gorilla in front of him! After all the surprise, he walks out of the building and gets back in his car. As he's going down the road, he wonders what would happen if someone were to touch this purple gorilla. He turns around, parks at the building, pays the $10, walks down the stairs, and there's the purple gorilla, back facing him again. He very gently pokes the gorilla on the shoulder and the gorilla furiously turns around while it beats it's chest and makes a purple gorilla noise. The man quickly runs up the stairs and out of the building with the purple gorilla chasing him. He gets in his car and speeds down the highway but he can't lose the gorilla. He's going as fast as his car can but the purple gorilla is right behind him. He keeps going and going for hours and hours until his car stops. He's ran out of gas. In fear, he locks his doors not knowing what else to do. The gorilla approaches his door and pulls it off. It beats it's chest and roars again as it quickly lies it's hand on the guy and says, ""You're it!"" and runs down the road.",Jokes

Anyway, I am at the interview/audition playing a couple songs for the owner.  The owner walks over to me after the first song and says, ""You're pretty good, man. What's that one called?""

Me: ""Fuck You Dude""

Owner: ""Excuse me?""

Me: ""Oh, no. 'Fuck You Dude.' It's the name of the song.""

The owner just kinda shrugs it off and tells me to show him what else I've got.  I play him another song, and he walks over, looking a bit apprehensive this time.

Owner: ""So uhh, whats that one called?

Me: ""It's called 'Your Mom's a Bitch.'""

Owner: ""Man, you've got the job, but we'll have to do something about those song names.""

So fast-forward to Friday night.  I'm playing, the crowd's feeling it, I'm feeling it, and everyone is buying me drinks because we're all having a good time.  Because of this, I have to step away from the keys for a moment to go drain the lizard.  I'm on my way back to stage when an angry woman stops me. She says, ""Excuse me sir.

0,AskScience Panel of Scientists XXI,"**Please read this entire post carefully and format your application appropriately.**

This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/amj68a/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xx/).

The panel is an informal group of redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

---

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,

* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.


------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).

* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)

* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)

* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?

* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

-----------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

1,AskScience AMA Series: We are scientists who have just announced new discoveries from NASA's Parker Solar Probe mission to the Sun. Ask us anything!,"We have just announced the [first results](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/nasas-parker-solar-probe-sheds-new-light-on-the-sun/) from Parker Solar Probe, NASA’s mission to touch the Sun!

Parker Solar Probe has flown closer to the Sun than any spacecraft has gone before, and its data from this region has given us insight into how the Sun releases the solar wind, clouds of solar material, and powerful bursts of energetic particles. The spacecraft also sent new views of what the dust environment is like near the Sun. These findings are based on data from the
spacecraft’s first two orbits. With 21 more solar flybys scheduled, there’s still much more to learn.

Ask us anything about what we’ve learned so far and what we’re looking forward to studying next!

31,How are space elevators supposed to maintain their speed when transporting mass from earth to the orbit?,"Because of newtons first law, the object that is being moved towards the counterweight would require horizontally (or rotational) effecting force in order to maintain it's route. I came into this conclusion because the counterweight orbits the anchored body and it should turn around the body faster than the body itself and applying vertical force to the climber doesn't cause it to gain horizontal (in this case rotational) speed. The speed required must be gained by slowing the counterweight which could lead to an imbalance and possibly break the whole system

During the era of the castle it was surrounded by water, but today it's a mile away from the coast. 

Looking at the map, I'd be lead to believe the reason for the difference is more natural (coastlines tend to change over time) than a result of melting glaciers. But I don't have the historical, geological know-how to back that up.

I understand that it goes through 14 decays before it stabilizes as Lead-206. I understand how radioactive decay works.

What I've gathered so far is that there's a rock in Australia where they found both Uranium-238 and Lead-206, which tells us that the rock has been around for 4.5 billion years because the half life is 4.5 billion years.

Why is some of the Uranium-238 still there? Why isn't that decayed?

Did they find the other decay states?

How do we know the Lead-206 came from Uranium-238 and didn't just exist there as Lead-206 or come from one of the other radioactive isotopes in the decay progression that has a much smaller half-life? Does Lead-206 and all other isotopes along the way only come from Uranium-238?",askscience

84,Can anyone explain nuclear reactor breeding ratios? And a few other questions.,"I'm currently working on a mod for a video game (Factorio) which overhauls how nuclear energy in the game works. Partly I'm doing this because the game makers saw fit to make solar power seem like a better option for power at scale, and partly because if I end up being able to get people interested in nuclear energy, then all the better. I want to teach with my mod, but teach to a crowd that is mildly curious and utterly ignorant, so I am starting them off with crayons instead of 3d modeling software.

I've hit something of an understanding wall, where my google-fu and existing knowledge are insufficient to get me over the next hurdle of understanding. My mod is designed to have 3 reactors available for use by the player:

Tier 1: 500MWe (2GWth) LWR. Assume this is one of the very first gen I light water reactors. Inefficient, not many best practices or improvements. Only 25% efficient overall. Huge material cost due to vast amounts of concrete and steel needed to construct the pressure/biological safeties.

Tier 2: 1GWe, 33% overall plant efficiency. This is to be either a Gen III+ or IV sodium fast reactor design. Because of how the game works, much of the beauty of it being a breeder reactor design will have to be moved from the reactor core itself to the fuel reprocessing cycle. I assume oxide or metal fuel. Fundamentally, it doesn't seem like sodium fuel rods are that different from LWR rods, apart from the specifics of engineering them (material choices, shape, pins instead of pellets, separating u235/pu239 from u238 so that you get better breeding, etc).

Tier 3: 1.5GWe, 45% overall efficiency. This is meant to be a thorium fueled molten salt reactor (no I don't think it's the godsend some people think, but I do think it's a decent idea worth exploring, I eagerly await results from China and India). Two-fluid design such that it gets a breeding ratio &gt; 1. This reactor will be the first (in the game) to use a high-temp gas for the turbine loop instead of steam. It will also feature an online fuel reprocessing facility built into the reactor site itself.

I have tier 1 pretty locked down. Documentation about how LWRs work is widely available, even to noobs like me. Tiers 2 and 3 are where I hit a few brick walls. With that, here is my wall of questions. You can pick and choose, answer them a few at at time, however you prefer. I just do better if I list everything I don't know because you can possibly save yourself a lot of time, or point out something I'm not considering. Note: None of these reactors are meant to generate anything but power. No weapons proliferation considerations.

* In a thermal reactor, U238 seems to release around 1.68 TJ/Kg, and U235 seems to be closer to 80 TJ/Kg. Are these numbers sane / close?

* In a fast reactor, U238 seems to release around 80.6TJ/Kg, and U235 releases around 79.6TJ/Kg. Sane numbers? For both thermal and fast, I'm happy with a sum energy output of the entire fuel cycle, rather than the energy for *just* the initial isotope fission.

* I need some help wrapping my head around how best to represent breeding ratios. If I have a breeding ratio of 1.3, then I generate 30% more Pu239 (assuming u238 is what's being bred) than I burn. But...where does that go? When does it get burned? It's not as though the Pu239 that gets bred magically contains 30% more energy. And, it's not as though the reactor suddenly goes prompt critical because too much Pu239 gets bred (I assume this can happen, but operators and engineers work hard to ensure it doesn't!) Do I represent this with a higher fuel burnup rate between refueling? I'm really scratching my head on what to do with this one.

* On the topic of burnup rates, it seems like 3% is a decent rate for LWR (sort of a median rate), 15% is decent for sodium fast reactors (upper end of the range), but I can't find anything for molten salt reactors. Some places claim 100% burnup, but that's impossible even with online reprocessing. I assumed 80%, but do you know a better number? Are my LWR/Sodium reactor numbers sane/in the right ballpark?

* Similar to the breeding ratio above, does the burnup number already factor in any breeding ratio? If so...I haven't done calculus in a decade. I'm not up to solving the differential equation(s) for the relation between burnup and breeding ratio (if there is one). Is there an approximation that would be 'good enough' rather than precise? (think newtonian physics vs general relativity)

* How much fuel (mass) is loaded in a typical LMR and MSR? I can't seem to find any data. The nearest ton, or even 10-tons would be fine. I try to scale the recipes in-game to take a reasonable amount of material. I can't find any data like I can with LWRs.

In the episode, a young adult patient had multiple tumors surrounding her vagina and clitoris and faced the choice between having a vaginectomy or possibly dying from the continued presence of the tumors.  Doctors indicated that intercourse would no longer be an option but that she could still have children via C-section (and IVF??) which would imply to me that this patient would be retaining her uterus and ovaries.  The patient eventually consents to a vaginectomy.

This got me to thinking.  What happens if you're still cycling, but there's no exit path for menstrual fluid?  I know that in the case of endometriosis there's immense pain &amp; can be other complications from endometrial-like cells growing outside of the uterus.

125,How would one find the density of sand *itself*? A thought experiment.,"What’s the density of the “average sand grain,” was my initial question basically, bc I want to exclude whatever the sand is suspended in (air or water). 

Then I derived a thought experiment: could you surmise this value given the difference in the mass of a cubic meter of sand+air mixture and a sand+water mixture. More specifically, define sand+air = a cubic meter of dry non-compact beach sand, sand+water = LESS than a cubic meter of sand barely saturated with water (a big assumption, as you will see in the equation, is that saturating this cubic meter of sand with water will compact it, and hence there will be a difference in volumes). I can’t post images on this subreddit, so I can’t share my handwritten work (I’m lazy to type it) but essentially I got down to this equation (1 is air, 2 is water):

D = (M2-M1+M1*-M2*)   /  (V2-V1)
M1: Mass of air+sand mixture 
M1*: Mass of JUST the air in this m^3
M2: Mass of water+sand mix 
M2*: Mass of JUST the water in this mix
V2: Volume of the water mix
V1: V of air mix (1 m^3)


Honestly, the equation kind of intuitively makes sense on its own, and kind of beautifully so—imagine you actually did this experiment. You’d basically just weigh a cubic meter of sand (quite damn big n heavy, but whatever) , then add water to the sand and allow the air to escape through bubbles until the mix is basically a cubic meter of sand barely saturated with water, no air. Well then, you could think of the density of *just* the sand grains as the difference in masses, adjusted by subtracting away the mass of water in the latter mix, and accounting for (adding) the mass of the air that escaped the system. Then divide by the delta in volume after the sand compresses. So both numerator and denominator are always negative under my assumption, sanity check. And I thought it was kind of cool how the forma only makes sense if the denominator is not 0–which is literally my assumption! 

Anyways, I got stuck because how do you know the % of space sand takes up in the air mix vs. water mix? You’d need to know this in order to surmise the mass of JUST air or water in their respective mixes. Someone help me!

150,How would a graviton enact an interaction with a photon near a black hole?,"So I was in class a couple of days ago and learned how the speed of information and causality is at c, (\~300,000,000m/s). But I had a question regarding how photons would be pulled into a black holes event horizon if the speculated gravitons max speed is c. Say we have a relatively small black hole, and a photon is travelling near it, surely a graviton to enact an interaction between the photon and ""attract"" it to the black hole would have to catch up to the photon which would mean it travelling faster than c. And also, the information that there is a photon near the black hole would require time to be ""processed"", in which time surely the photon would already be outside of the black holes gravitational field, far before a graviton can be made aware of the photon to enact an interaction?

175,"How can one side of the brain do ""all the work"" after a Hemispherectomy?","I've been reading about hemispherectomies and I find the operation both fascinating and baffling. I understand that the brain can only adapt when it's done to children because they have a higher degree of neuroplasticity and that at an early age the brain can ""rewire"" itself and basically be a completely functional brain; what I don't understand is, how can the brain adapt to losing half of its neurons? I know that the number of neurons isn't the only relevant number and I assume that the number of synapses grows significantly in the remaining hemisphere, but it's baffling that the brain can adapt to such damage. Is the number of synapses that much more important?

The idea that the brain can function after losing 50% of it's matter also brings up a lot of questions I'd love to know the answer to. Is the brain simply not as efficient as it could be in normal people and that's why one half (that is I assume more efficient) can compensate so well? If so, is this the reason why there is a such an immense difference between people? Is the brain of a genius simply more like the remaining half of someone who went through a hemispherectomy? Are most brains simply stupid compared to what they could be if they reached their full potential?

But in many diagrams, you have a fermion line that goes vertically (examples: one diagram of compton scattering, neutral pion decay). 

As I interpret it,  this actually stands for a superposition of two diagrams -  one where this line represents a fermion and one where it represents an antifermion. You would then have to sum over those two matrix elements. Is that a valid interpretation?",askscience

196,"Why is regular/dark matter (w=0) said to slow down expansion? I thought the Friedman equations say that energy density, regardless of equation of state, cause expansion?","I know that w=0 for matter leads to a shrinking energy density as the universe grows, and therefore the contribution to H from matter will shrink, but this is different from matter reducing the value of H.  If more dirt was added to the universe, wouldn't the energy density and thus acceleration increase?  Eventually the dirt would become spread out by the size of the universe and its contribution would tend toward 0, but never is this dirt slowing the expansion.

&amp;nbsp;

It sounds pedantic, but as I understand it a better description would be that: w=0 matter adds to expansion in a way that decreases with a and therefore time, and so in a matter dominated universe the expansion slows (but doesn't stop, see the a~t^2/3 equation or whatever) due to a's increasing, not directly due to that matter.  This makes a difference as when I was taught it, the reductive ""dark matter slows expansion"" statement misled me greatly.

242,"Location of Atolls, Atlantic Vs Pacific? And several other Atoll related questions"," 

Hello I've recently been creating a fantasy map and was looking up Atolls and I've several questions about them.

The first, is why are there so few Atolls in the Atlantic (only off the coast of Belize) while the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean are chalk full of them. I presume this is due to lack of Volcanic activity in the Atlantic ocean in area where reefs can form but then that leads to another question about the lack of Volcanic hot-spots in the Atlantic.

The second question I have is the removal of the former Island that the coral reef rings around. How does this precisely happen? I recall watching a video where it was stated that the weight of the reef somehow has something to do with it, or is it more to do with Erosion (wouldn't a barrier reef prevent erosion to a degree)?

And the last question I have is concerning the make up of islands. Since New Caldonia (&gt;40MYA) is older geologically speaking than Midway Island (27MYA) and the two are completely different (one is an Atoll the other is a proper island). Which is a roundabout way of asking, is the geological makeup of an Atoll more prone to erosion than a ""regular"" island?",askscience

Even more, if you have four potential values per transistor, that is 16 options. So if Moore's law is just about packing more and more transistors into a (relatively) finite chip space, have computer scientists considered that there might be other options besides binary that could be more optimal?

For some background: patients with blood cancers such as myelomas and leukemias often receive infusions of blood progenitor stem cells to help restore their immune systems after chemo or radiation therapy. Often, these transplants come from an identical or haploidentical donor who does not have cancer. However, some patients may receive autologous transplants in which their own cells are harvested before and then reinfused after chemo.

This might be really dumb, but this is what I'm confused by: Why don't the patients just develop their cancer again after receiving these transplants? Wouldn't they be getting back some of their cancer cells? Are these transplants only done if the patient's cancer is mostly eradicated? Or am I misunderstanding something?

307,"Genetics : Can a ""crossing over"" happen between X and Y chromosomes ?","Hey Askscience, I'd need help from some people that know a little in Genetics.

In general, since X and Y chromosomes aren't homologous, the Y one being smaller, ""crossing-overs"" can't happen between then. 

In any way, I read in some science magazines, that the X and the Y chromosomes still have some homologous parts between them. So would this mean that a ""crossing-over would happen ?

&amp;#x200B;

Background info : In bio class we had a test on genetics. The subject was on the color of a cat's robe, which depends on 2 allelles from X chromosomes. Eumelanin that codes a black fur and Phreomelanin that codes an orange fur. Plenty of female cats have a ""tortie"" fur, a mix of both colours, since they have 2 X chromosomes. Our aim was to show how certain male cats could have a ""tortie"" robe.

The main answer was a trisomy, after during Anaphase I so one of the cells had 2X chrs, one with the Xn allelle and on with Xr allelle. If this cell had children, there could be one with XrXnY, which would be a male ""tortie"".

If the loci of Xn and Xr aren't the same, there can be a crossing-over between the 2X's leading to one X having both allelles and the male descendant would also be ""tortie"".

But if the loci of the allelles weren't specified in the test subject, we can perfectly extrapolate if the X and Y chromosomes have only a small Homologuous part, there can be a crossing-over between them (even really unlikely) so one allelle is on the Y chromosome, and a descendant could be XnYr or XrYn ?

My teacher is really stubborn, she only believes in the magazine ""Nature"". But any renowned scientific could be ok.

324,Why is the sitting position of birds stable despite looking like they should tip over?,"Birds have the feet position of dinosaurs but have no tails. In most cases their apparent center of mass is forwards of their feet. This would cause them to fall over. What causes their true center of mass to be in a different position than it would appear?

Secondly their legs attach to the body further back of where the feet touch the ground. This causes torque wanting to rotate the bird face down. How is this torque countered? Doesnt it put more stress on the joint?

&gt;The brain is just slow. It doesn't work fast. It works quite slowly. And there's many domains in which that's the case. In many ways the most striking one is vision. If you look at the visual system, the cells of the retina are actually responsive to single photons of light. They give you a maximal amount of information. The brain doesn't want all that information. It'd just be way overloaded if it ever got that kind of information inside. So whatever the visual system is doing, the first step is throwing out almost all the information that's coming from the retina. And apparently every sensory system is like that. The first thing it does is throw away just about everything. And try to get down to something limited enough so this slow brain up here can deal with it somehow.

372,Why does the compression of fuel/air in an engine increase vaporization?,"In a 4 stroke engine, during the compression stroke, a gasoline/air mixture is compressed inside the combustion chamber. This decrease in volume leads to an increase in pressure which in turn leads to an increase in temperature. I understand that the increased temperature leads to better fuel vaporization (for the same reason that boiling a pot of water will increase the vaporization of that water.) However, the pressure is also increasing - doesn't that work against the goal of increasing the fuel vaporization? In other words, doesn't the increased pressure work to condense the fuel out of vapor and into droplets? 

Maybe both of these forces are acting on the fuel, but the temperature increase has a larger effect and ""wins out"" causing more vaporization to occur than the pressure increase causes condensation. How is the amount of vaporization even measured?

I've been trying to figure out exactly *how* a compression stroke in an engine increases the engine's efficiency. I've found many articles/posts about the effect of the increase in temperature, but nothing mentioning the condensing effects of increased pressure.

As a tangent, if I take a sealed disposable water bottle with a few droplets of water in it, and I twist it ([like this](https://apictureofvancouveraday.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/twisted-water-bottle.jpg)) to increase the pressure inside, the temperature will increase. If I then leave the bottle untouched for a while, so that the heat dissipates and it returns to room temperature then there will be fewer water molecules in a gaseous state compared to before I twisted the bottle. Is that correct?",askscience

381,What is the difference between the vapor pressure and critical point of a liquid?,"So as I understand it vapor pressure is the pressure inside a container when the liquid has evaporated enough to fully saturate the rest of the container and it reaches a equilibrium. This is what gives some aerosol cans their consistent pressure when a liquid like butane evaporates at is vapor pressure to fill the space when using a can. This is also why a cold can has less pressure, because the vapor pressure is lower correct?

Where as the critical point is when a liquid and it’s vapor coexist in equilibrium. And it becomes super critical above this point where the gas and liquid are basically the same density. 

So what exactly is the difference? If C02 has a vapor pressure of 350 kPa at 25c as I understand then why is the supercritical point 7,380 kPa at 31c when both would be a liquid and a gas in a container, I don’t understand the differences between the two.

However, for high altitude flight (decompression and exposure to external pressure), the FAA publishes a table of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time\_of\_useful\_consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_of_useful_consciousness) where the TUC at 37,000 feet is 30 seconds to 1 minute; half that much if there were a rapid decompression. 

At higher altitudes, all the way out to space, the TUC is only a handful of seconds.

Why?

Intuitively, I completely understand that the loss of partial O2 pressure will make my breathing inefficient, but even assuming the worst case that I can't receive ANY new oxygen from the atmosphere, I should be able at least to match my apnea performance at sea level using the oxygen I already have in my bloodstream.

Since TUC is way shorter than that, I must assume that there is another factor at play, specifically that I must be effectively losing some of the oxygen that was already in my body.

384,What is the role of norepinephrine in comorbid ADHD and anxiety?,"I'm going to try my best to provide sources, but a lot of them disagree with each other which is pretty much why I'm asking this question.

So apparently ADHD is linked to a deficiency of norepinephrine ([x](https://www.additudemag.com/adhd-neuroscience-101/)). Norepinephrine is also linked to the fight or flight response, and increases heart rate, blood pressure and anxiety ([x](https://www.hormone.org/your-health-and-hormones/glands-and-hormones-a-to-z/hormones/norepinephrine), [x](https://www.healthline.com/health/epinephrine-vs-norepinephrine)). Comorbid ADHD and anxiety are also very common ([x](https://www.webmd.com/add-adhd/anxiety-adhd-link#1)). I've heard anxiety (specifically GAD) described as a permanent/extended fight or flight response where there is no danger but the brain/body still thinks there is. Since norepinephrine raises with anxiety/the fight or flight response, it is higher in those with anxiety or extended stress than without ([x](https://exploringyourmind.com/chronic-anxiety-and-its-link-to-norepinephrine/)). It seems to me that ADHD has a chronic deficiency of norepinephrine, while those with chronic anxiety generally have too much. How can these two things be true at the same time? 

Would it be possible for someone with ADHD to also have a condition that results in elevated norepinephrine, such as hyperPOTS, pheochromocytoma, or chronic stress? I'm pretty sure that chronic stress doesn't cure ADHD, but wouldn't it balance out your levels if they were already low? A sudden scare can trigger a release of epinephrine/norepinephrine (adreneline rush). But I don't think that purposely scaring ADHD people helps them focus?

Conditions that increase norepinephrine (specifically hyperPOTS and pheochromocytoma) are partially diagnosed by a blood test to test the norepinephrine levels in the blood ([x](https://www.healthline.com/health/catecholamines-blood)). If a blood test can accurately find out if there is too much norepinephrine, why can't a blood test that tests for low levels be used to diagnose ADHD?

Finally, SNRIs seem like a common treatment for anxiety. However, they increase norepinephrine. Isn't this the last thing you would want if you are already feeling anxious? 

TL;DR: ADHD and anxiety are often comorbid. But ADHD has a chronic deficiency of norepinephrine, while chronic anxiety can lead to high levels. How can both be true at once?",askscience

445,What is the relationship between the mass of a spacecraft and its angle of re-entry?,"I am an author of interactive fiction. In 2003 I released a game called *To Hell in a Hamper,* a one-room game in which takes place aboard a sealed hydrogen balloon in 1876. The basic mechanic of the game is that you have to throw stuff overboard in order to gain enough altitude to pass safely over an erupting volcano.  


16 years later, I'm working on a loose sequel, set on board an imaginary British space module in 1967. The module has failed to reach the moon, the calculations having been thrown off by a lot of extraneous stuff having been smuggled on board by the astronauts prior to take off. It is now heading back to Earth. My idea for the game is similar to the first one, in that you have to jettison mass in order to correct the angle of entry, so all that extra stuff has to go out through the jettison hatch.   


Like the first game, it's not particularly realistic, but like the first game, I would like it to have *some* basis in reality. So my question in broad, general terms, is would ejecting mass from a spacecraft re-entering Earth's atmosphere cause it re-enter at a shallower angle? Assume that the astronauts have limited fuel and no other options at their disposal.

If closed strings can move through different universes, doesn’t that violate the law of conservation of energy in our universe? Sure, energy is used to make that string (maybe a Big Bang from another universe or something), but if it did not originate from our universe and energy from our universe was not used to create it, then our universe just had an increase in its total energy/mass. Or on the other hand, if a closed stringed particle created by our Big Bang leaves our universe, then our universe lost some of its total energy. But both ways, this means that the universe isn’t actually an isolated system (because energy entered the universe), or the law of conservation was violated for a split second.

Even if it’s equally as sunny here as it would be in the tropics, I think I burn less. Is this due to latitudinal difference or is there other factors at play?",askscience
492,What motivates a neuron's connection seeking behaviour?,"In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU40wygYVkU), we see  a bunch of very agitated neurons moving around seeking to create connections with other neurons. What models do we have to explain this connection seeking behaviour? Studying artificial neural networks gives me a good feeling of how a computational task can be performed by a network of neurons but the methods used in computer science to make a neural network ""learn"" seem very remote from the actual thing that is happening in a biological neuron network when it is learning and making new connections. Also could someone explain what exactly we see in this video? I understand we are looking at neurons but what are the little white points that are moving around? Are they the nucleus of the neurons and if yes why are they moving so much?",askscience

We were living in Japan up until 10 months ago, so my daughter had exposure to Japanese and was able to produce/recognize Japanese. Now that we've been back in the states, she no longer produces nor recognizes Japanese, and this caused me to wonder how exactly the human brain goes about forgetting things. I'm not exactly interested in the mechanism of forgetting, but I am wondering if it's a statistical process. A baby needs to quickly learn which stimuli are important and which are unimportant. Therefore, while we were in Japan and she was hearing Japanese every day, Japanese words were deemed important because they had a high statistical frequency. Now that we're in the states and no one speaks Japanese, the signal strength of Japanese decays to a point that it is no longer deemed important. Is this intuition correct?

Obviously I would like our venture to continue happily for some years and so I am curious about which factors lead to the best outcomes. For example:

- On the scale between everything being owned in common and everything being individually owned, where do the most successful communes/co-ops lie? (Is there a name or established theory for this scale?)  
  
- Does religiosity affect the success of communes? What about other commonly held values like sustainability?  
  
- Are more successful groups also more/less homogenous in terms of gender, age, wealth, education, religion, race/ethnicity etc?  
  
If there are other factors which I have not considered, I would like to hear about those as well.

594,How to compute the probability of committing one or more type II errors when performing multiple hypothesis tests?,"If I want to estimate if the population distribution (called 𝓐; e.g. pharmacokinetics of 1st drug) described by N samples is identical to a given population distribution (called 𝓑; e.g. pharmacokinetics of 2nd drug), by comparing three different statistics of 𝓐 (computed from those same N samples; e.g. [AUC, C\_max, T\_max](https://i.imgur.com/jxZZkLG.png)) against 𝓑, via three hypothesis tests that determine if there are any differences in the population means of those three statistics; i.e.:

* Are both drugs' expected AUC equal? i.e. E\[AUC of 𝓐\] = E\[AUC of 𝓑\]
* Are both drugs' expected C\_max equal? i.e. E\[C\_max of 𝓐\] = E\[C\_max of 𝓑\]
* Are both drugs' expected T\_max equal? i.e. E\[T\_max of 𝓐\] = E\[T\_max of 𝓑\]

&amp;#x200B;

And if each of those three hypotheses (whose null hypothesis assumes that the population means are equal) have the same properties described below:

* α = 5% = probability of committing a [type I error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors#Type_I_error) (i.e. rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true).
* β = 20% = probability of committing a [type II error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors#Type_II_error) (i.e. failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false).

&amp;#x200B;

Then I have two questions:

1. Is the probability of committing one or more type I errors when performing three hypothesis tests = [FWER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_comparisons_problem#Controlling_procedures) = 1 - (1-α)\^3 = 1 - (1-0.05)\^3 = 14.26%
2. How do I compute the probability of committing one or more type II errors when performing three hypothesis tests?

625,"AskScience AMA Series: Hi! We're experts from the National Institutes of Health, the National Toxicology Program, and the American Botanical Council studying the quality, safety, and effectiveness of botanical dietary supplements and essential oils. Ask us anything!","Botanical dietary supplements, sometimes called herbals or herbal dietary supplements, and essential oils are products made from plants, plant parts, or plant extracts. One study found that natural products, including botanical dietary supplements, are used by approximately [15% of adults](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29211315) and are widely available in the United States. In fact, according to the [American Botanical Council](http://cms.herbalgram.org/press/2019/2018HerbMarketReport.html), Americans spent a total of $8.8 billion on botanical dietary supplements in 2018.

But, just because a product is from a plant source and sold in stores or online, doesntt mean it's safe. The safety of a botanical or essential oil depends on many things, such as its chemical makeup, how it works in the body, how it is prepared, and the dose used.

The amount of scientific evidence available for various botanical supplement ingredients varies widely, in part, because product safety is not tested by FDA and federal law does not require dietary supplements be tested for effectiveness before they are marketed.

Studying the potential effects of botanical dietary supplements has several unique challenges. For example, all botanical dietary supplements contain a complex mixture of ingredients, making it difficult to identify and link active ingredients to health effects. Growing, harvesting, and processing conditions can also affect the chemical makeup of a botanical supplement, leading to challenges in manufacturing identical products batch after batch. Possible contaminants - either accidental or intentional via adulteration - in botanical dietary supplements (e.g. heavy metals, microbes, undeclared ingredients, or pesticides) needs to be
determined as part of routine quality control since these can affect its safety.

Our hosts today are all experts on studying the quality, safety, and/or efficacy of botanical dietary supplements and essential oils to better understand how to use them more safely and effectively.

656,"Is the ""vacuum"" state of a field in QFT relative or absolute?","In some theories of expansion, the extremely fast expansion in the early universe can be explained by a field in a unique ""false vacuum"" high-energy state.  From my understanding it's called a ""false vacuum"" because even though it was relatively stable (like a ""true vacuum""), there were large energy discrepancies between this field and the other field.

The energy in this field eventually distributed itself into other fields, resulting in the creation of particles and slowing down  expansion.  Some theorists also posit that dark energy is coming from a similar source - a high-energy field in a ""false vacuum.""   Some theorists go further to suggest the idea of ""vacuum collapse"" where this dark-energy field redistributes it's energy, resulting in a redefinition of all particles.

My question is thus: do these theories make any claims about an ""absolute zero"" for a quantum field, or is all ""energy"" in a quantum field relative?  We are able to measure the energy in these theoretical fields due to their effect on our universe, but is this measure of energy an absolute measure or is it just a measuring energy discrepancy?

To take it a step further, is there anything in QFT that would stop me positing the existence of *another unknown* field that could serve as an energy sink for this current universe?  I mean, obviously there is no proof that this field exists - we would need to see some sort of observable effect on our universe in order to begin seriously entertaining the idea - but I'm wondering if there are any theoretical concepts that pin down ""negative"" (relative to our current universe) QFT energies.",askscience

660,Do dog behaviours show cultural variation depending on geographic origin?,"We ran a shelter for Balkan street dogs.  As I had little knowledge of dogs up to that point, I assumed what I learned from these dogs was 'how dogs were'.  When we returned home, we brought two emotionally damaged dogs, as they had no alternative but death.  This meant a lot of training, and work with a behaviourist, which is where the question comes from.

All the soft-eared dogs we sheltered carried their ears pressed back high on the skull, letting the tips fall loose, with the inside of the ear facing out, when relaxed.  When angry or stressed, their ears would be lower and pressed straight back, with the inside facing inward to the skull -- a quite  different placement.  

The behaviourist  insisted that *any* time a dog pressed its ears back it was unhappy/threatened.  Despite any progress the dogs made,  every visit consisted of her telling me how I was failing these dogs because they were so stressed.  Eventually, I just stopped going.

It's a decade later.  The dogs, now well adapted and trained,  still carry their ears folded at all times unless they are specifically interested in something right ahead of them, or I am talking with them:  then the ears are up and forward, like a collie.  As they age, I am wondering whether or not I've given them the best I could, and those ears still puzzle and, I admit, upset me.  Is it possible the street dogs of the Balkans simply have a different culture, one in which  laid back ears can communicate different things depending on the *way* in which they are laid back?  Is there research on dog postural communication that takes into account differing geographic/situational origins?

665,"On the level of hardware, how do pointers work?","So I understand that when I'm writing a linked list, and a node points to another node, it is the memory address where the first node is stored pointing to another. So like if you have a table of memory addresses, if the first node is stored at memory location n and the second node is stored at memory location k, you would just have to iterate (k-n) times through the table (from node n) to get to location k. However, I'd assume that in a real system, you may sometimes run into a problem where weirdly spaced blocks of this memory table have been allocated to other programs. More formally, if I have a memory demand of k memory units for some program x, and there is already an allocated block of memory for some program z starting at (address k minus some non-zero constant y) and ending at an address n s.t n&gt;k; will my memory assignment program try to reallocate the memory for z or will it split the memory for program x into blocks 1:(0,k-y) and 2:(n,k)? If it is the latter then doesn't that present a routing problem? As in if my memory circuit is laid out in vertical rows where the height of each row is (length of memory address table/number of rows), and i have a large gap between blocks 1 and 2(one that may even span multiple rows), at some point,I hypothesize that it may become quicker to traverse the memory circuit horizontally rather than to iterate through the entire block of program z-s allocated memory. 
TL;DR:
Can a memory circuit be visualized as a linked list? Does memory always reallocate? If it doesn't, does traversing the memory circuit linearly between referenced memory locations impose a demand on processing power? Why can't we (or do we) produce circuits where memory units are laid out in a ""complete graph"" configuration where every unit is connected to every other unit?",askscience

I'll expand on this into a couple questions.

1.  He speaks about there being a divergence, duplication, or split of worlds when a wave function collapses.  He says that the other ""world"" exists in a different set of dimensions in Hilbert space.  (I think I'm understanding this correctly but please correct if wrong).  My question is, how does the duplication or split not require more energy than what was already contained within the particle?  How is there a duplication without the need for added energy?  If you don't need additional energy, wouldn't the resulting ""world's"" particle have less energy than the original one?
2. Once the wave function of the particle collapses, is it then always ""collapsed"" in all worlds? Or can it then split yet again?
3. How do we know that quantum particles are actually probabilistic instead of us just not understanding why they appear to behave that way?  Couldn't a fast enough oscillation between two states make it appear that a particle/wave function follows a given probability?
4. Does referring to these particles as ""wave functions"" mean that they are supposedly just mathematical principles floating around and not actual packets or energy or particles?  The way this subject is talked about makes it seem that the people studying this believe this to be the case.

715,How does kinetic energy make sense from different inertial systems?,"A friend and I have trouble making sense of a very basic fact of Newtonian Physics.
Kinetic energy grows quadratically with velocity. This made sense to me until my friend suggested the following thought experiment:
3 bodies A, B and C rest next to each other not affected by any forces. A stays still while B and C accelerate to, say, 10 m/s, gaining an amount of kinetic energy x. In respect to each other, B and C are not moving. Now C accelerates to 20 m/s relative to A and 10 m/s relative to B. This increases C's kinetic energy to 4x. From B's perspective, this looks like an acceleration from 0 to 10 m/s but required 3x energy.

719,"Why do cosmologists hypothesize the existence of unobservable matter or force(s) to fit standard model predictions instead of assuming that the standard model is, like classical mechanics, incomplete?","It seems as though popular explanations of concepts like dark matter and dark energy come in the form of ""the best mathematical model we currently have to fit a set of observations, such as the cosmic background radiation and the apparent acceleration of inflation, imply that there must be far more matter and more energy than the matter and energy that we can observe, so we hypothesize the existence of various forms of dark matter and dark energy.""

This kind of explanation seems baffling. I would think that if a model doesn't account for all of the observations, such as *both* CBR and acceleration *and* the observed amount of matter and energy in the universe, then the most obvious hypothesis would not be that there must be matter and energy we can't observe, but that the mathematical model must be inaccurate. In other fields, if a model doesn't account for observations using methods that were themselves used to construct the model, it is far more natural to think that this would tend to suggest that the model is wrong or incomplete rather than that the observations are wrong or incomplete. 

There seems to be an implied rejoinder: the Standard Model of the universe is really accurate at mathematically formulating many observations and predicting many observations that were subsequently confirmed, and there is so far no better model, so we have reason to think that unobservable things implied by it actually exist unless someone can propose an even better mathematical model. This also seems baffling: why would the assumption be that reality conforms to a single consistent mathematical formulation discoverable by us or any mathematical formulation at all? Ordinarily we would think that math can represent idealized versions of the physical world but would not insist that the physical world conform itself to a mathematical model. For example, if we imagine handling a cylindrical container full of water, which we empty into vessel on the scale, if the weight of the of the water is less than that which would be predicted according to the interior measurements of the container and the cylinder volume equation, no one would think to look for 'light liquid,' they would just assume that the vessel wasn't a perfect cylinder, wasn't completely full of water, or for some other reason the equation they were using did not match the reality of the objects they were measuring. 

So this is puzzling to me.

It is also sufficiently obvious a question that I assume physicists have a coherent answer to it which I just haven't heard (I also haven't this question posed, but I'm not a physicist so it wouldn't necessarily come up). 

Could someone provide that answer or set of answers?

726,Doesn't multipartite entanglement enable instantaneous communication?,"Say Bob has two choices, A and B, and he wants to let Alice know which one he's picked at time point t sooner than information travelling at the speed of light could get to her. To accomplish that, before they part ways, they produce many 3-qubit entanglements, each in a [GHZ state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state) \[i.e. in a superposition of (|000&gt; + |111&gt;)/sqrt(2)\]. Bob takes one of the involved particles from each entanglement with him while Alice keeps the other two per system. Their plan of communication is that if Alice, at a time point shortly after t, tests her pairs for entanglement with sufficient confidence, she will assume Bob chose A, otherwise B.

Light years apart, at time point t, Bob now selects one of the two options.  
If his choice falls on A, he leaves his particles undisturbed, so that Alice's test results soon after should still strongly suggest the entanglement of her respective pairs of particles. Which would lead her to suspect Bob selected A.  
If he goes for B, he measures all of his particles, collapsing the respective superpositions to either |000&gt; or |111&gt;, which are unentangled pure states. Alice's test for entanglement then likely reveals the new random nature in absence of entanglement (e.g. different spin directions when measured at certain angles). Her conclusion would be that Bob selected/sent B.

750,Does the subject experiencing a stimulus has a role to play(brings a change) in the strength of the corresponding spike generated by the neurons?,"In [""Spike arrival times: A highly efficient coding scheme for neural networks""](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/247621744_Spike_arrival_times_A_highly_efficient_coding_scheme_for_neural_networks) , THORPE points out that ""It is a well known neurophysiological fact that the time taken for a neuron to reach its threshold for generating a spike depends on the strength of the stimulus - the stronger the stimulus, the faster the neuron depolarizes and the sooner it generates a spike."" From this statement, which assertion would be correct? 

A : regardless of the subject, it is only the strength measurement of the signal causing the stimulus that impacts how quickly the threshold is reached.

B : depending on the subject, the recognition of the signal ""by"" the subject (or lack thereof) causes an increase(or relative decrease) in the speed at which the threshold is reach and so for a signal of exactly the same strength the corresponding threshold to generate a spike varies depending on the subject. 

C : It depends on the type of signal and the mechanism behind the neurophysiological encoding that is taking place that transduces the signal into a spike. (aka some thresholds are ""hard-wired"" into the encoding process and remain ""as is"" while others are modified by overlapping cognitive processes, for example the ""urgency"" of the response regarding a certain signal could change the threshold at which the spike is continued into a spike train)",askscience

The frequency ω is plotted against the wave vector k, but how do I actually read it? Do I search for a frequency and look which modes are ""(co)existing"" at that frequency? Or do I pick a wave vector (a direction) and look which frequencies are allowed for these values of k? I can probably read it both ways, but where is cause and effect exactly?

Here's what I know: Let's assume a 2D case with a simple Brillouin Zone Γ-X-Y-Γ. The sections of the dispersion relation correspond to values of k, where Γ denotes the point where k is very small and the wavelength λ is very large. Traveling along the x-axis is basically like traversing the edges of the Brillouin Zone, covering all possible directions of the wave vector.

1. Suppose, a dispersion branch for Γ-X has two possible frequencies. What is the ""real world meaning"" of that? Do both these modes exist at a certain excitation frequency?
2. Now assume there are two different branches that occur at the same frequency inside Γ-X. Does that make it any different than case 1 where the same branch has one frequency twice?

While ethanol boils at a lower temperature than water, a pressure cooker usually reaches a much higher temperature than both liquids' boiling point. On the other hand, ethanol has a higher vapour pressure, so it should reduce the maximum temperature that can be achieved before the valve opens. How would the mixture behave? Would it release mostly ethanol?

Is there maybe an easy formula/rule of thumb with which the composition and release temperature of an (initial) ethanol/water mixture can be predicted (given a certain maximum pressure)?

Specifically when I had a quartz watch and I glanced to look at the time I always felt like the first second took an unusually long time (relative to a second) before the hand ticked and the watch then seemed to continue about its normal per second tick.

Having recently purchased an automatic watch I now notice a similar effect. The second hand is continually sweeping - however for a very short period of time, upon initial glance it appears totally stationary (perhaps for 1/4 to 1/2 of a second) This effect can be re-seen by looking away from the watch / rotating wrist away so that clock face isn't visible and then bringing it back in to view. It's subtle but noticeable.

My question therefore is what is the mechanism in which the brain detects motion of small moving/rotating objects, and is it plausible that there is a delay in doing so leading to the effect I am seeing (second hand appearing stationary for 1/4 to 1/2 a second upon first glance)

Since neutrinos have an incredibly tiny mass compared to other particles, does this mean that sterile neutrinos, which are the opposite of normal neutrinos, are the same thing as heavy neutrinos as they’re opposite so the opposite of a tiny mass particle is a heavy mass particle. Also, I also learnt that the value of the Hubble constant has conflicting data taken from 3 different sources, each being the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, the afterglow of the Big Bang, Type 1a Supernovae, when a white dwarf takes matter from a larger star that it in a binary pair with it until it explodes, and Quasars, black holes with extremely bright accretion disks. He said that this shows that, if all the results are taken properly, this shows that the Cosmological Constant is increasing over time. He also said in another video that the cause of this could be unknown physics such as a fast moving particle such as sterile neutrinos. In a third video, he says that if more neutrinos exist, such as the sterile neutrinos, then it’s evidence that the early universe would’ve expanded faster than current observational data assumes.

My question is: Why did the Xenon get burned off in just these crucial seconds? Xenon burnoff is proportional to neutron flow, which again is proportional to reactor power. Sure, reactor power did increase in these seconds, but even if we assume a reactor power of 10 GW during these 10 seconds, the total burnoff should have been the same as would have happened, if the previous level of 200 MW had been kept for an additional 500 seconds, i.e. eight minutes.

So, did the Xenon concentration by a stroke of ridiculously bad luck sink below some important threshold just during the power excursion?

However, this does not correspond with my understanding of the two concepts. My impression is that ""Newtonian"" implies a viscosity that is independent of the applied shear stress (that is, not having any description of spatial dependence), while ""isotropic"" implies that properties are invariant regardless of the direction of travel.

879,Can someone explain the spontaneity of time symmetry breaking in the Lukin and Monroe time crystal experiments?,"As I understand it:
In both experiments, there was a drive (lasers in Monroe's, microwave pulses in Lukin's) that causes a change in spin state of a system (Monroe: a chain of ytterbium ions; Lukin: defects in a diamond). In both cases, the spin states of these systems revert back to their original state. However, the drives were periodically applied, and the resulting spin state oscillation did not match the periodicity of the drive, but oscillated at 1/2 or 1/3 the frequency.

(I may have misunderstood this - I'm a biologist, not a physicist. Please correct me if so).

The  reason is that general relativity is a geometric theory of a  four-dimensional spacetime, that is, three dimensions of space and one  dimension of time.

If I put a bottle of water in a room and start removing heat from the room, the water will first lose its sensible heat until it gets to 0 C.

Then, the water will give up its latent heat and start freezing. Since ice is less dense than liquid water, it will start to expend in volume as well.

But if my bottle is closed, the ice will build pressure inside it until it breaks. The ice will do ""work"" on the bottle.

My question is: how could the formation of ice break the bottle if the water is already giving up energy as heat? Is there a force known as ""work energy of crystal formation"" that would explain it? How could it be explained on an atomic level?

922,Why is equipartition of energy expected in the modes of a resonant cavity? And why this should model a solid radiator?,"I think the answer for this may be straightforward, but I don't see anywhere that explains this from the scratch:  


A large resonant cavity with a small hole is used to approximate an ideal black body.   


I understand the conditions for the modes inside the cavity. But there are two points that aren't clear to me:  


1) I don't understand why it was considered that the energy should be equipartitioned between those modes. Because I don't see a reason why they couldn't be independent.   


At least not if it was ideally reflecting body inside. In that case, just like in ideal vibrating  stings, there could be no exchange of energy between the modes and the spectrum of the light inside it would be just like the spectrum of the light entering it.  


I think the story has to do with the body not being perfectly reflecting and being in equilibrium with the modes inside the cavity. But even then: Why couldn't it just stay in equilibrium with the modes that has already being formed by the light that entered the cavity? Is the equipartition being mediated by the material portion of the cavity?

2) Why exactly does particular solution serves as a model for entirely solid radiators? Does this EM field modes exist inside opaque materials?",askscience

But one detail I am not clear on is why a low thermal output (200mw), in itself, would make an accident more likely. The book states that the thermal output of the reactor during the backup power test was meant to be between 700 and 1000mw, but one of the people supervising the test insisted that the reactor's thermal output be brought down to 200mw. The book speculates that this person insisted on the lower thermal output because he assumed it would be safer, and to my (layman's) mind, this seems to make sense. 

As it happened, due to operator error, the thermal output of the reactor dropped to around 30mw, leading to xenon poisoning in the reactor. To bring the reactor back up to 200mw, virtually all of the control rods in the reactor were manually removed and numerous automatic failsafes were overridden. Supposing instead that the reactor was gradually brought down from its normal operating level to 200mw, could something still have gone wrong owing only to the low thermal output?",askscience
