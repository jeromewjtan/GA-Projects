GOP strains to contain Bolton fallout in impeachment trial ,https://apnews.com/34f8a36cfc3a15ffeede3a74cd0c123a,2020-01-29,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial is shifting to questions from senators, a pivotal juncture as Republicans lack the votes to block witnesses and face a potential setback in their hope of ending the trial with a quick acquittal. Despite Trump’s defense team’s plea for it to “end now,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell privately told senators he doesn’t yet have the votes to brush back Democratic demands for witnesses now that revelations from John Bolton, the former national security adviser, have roiled the trial. Republican senators are trying to figure out a way to to deal with fallout from Bolton’s forthcoming book, which provides a potential eyewitness account of Trump’s actions at the heart of the impeachment charges. But ideas being floated are fizzling almost as soon as they arise — among them, a witness “swap” with Democrats or issuing a subpoena for Bolton’s manuscript. One key Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, gave fresh momentum Wednesday to a one-for-one witness deal saying it’s “very important that there be fairness, that each side be able to select a witness or two.” But Democrats dismissed those offers, especially as Republicans want to draw Joe Biden’s son, Hunter, deeper into the proceedings. GOP senators are being warned that calling Bolton as a witness could entangle the trial in lengthy legal battles and delay Trump’s expected acquittal. Bolton writes in a forthcoming book that Trump told him he wanted to withhold military aid from Ukraine until it helped with investigations into Democratic rival Joe Biden. That assertion, if true, would undercut a key defense argument and go to the heart of one of the two articles of impeachment against the president. “I think Bolton probably has something to offer us,” said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska. Trump disagreed in a tweet Wednesday in which he complained that Bolton, after he was fired, “goes out and IMMEDIATELY writes a nasty & untrue book. All Classified National Security.” The president had tweeted shortly after midnight about his former adviser, asking why Bolton didn’t complain earlier. Bolton left the White House last September and says he offered his resignation. The uncertainty about witnesses arises days before crucial votes on the issue. In a Senate split 53-47 in favor of Republicans, at least four GOP senators must join all Democrats to reach the 51 votes required to call witnesses, decide whom to call or do nearly anything else in the trial. Several Republicans apparently are ready to join Democrats in calling witnesses. The two days set aside for questions, Wednesday and Thursday, also allow each side more time to win over any undecided senators pondering the witness issue. In the meantime, all will have the opportunity to grill both the House Democrats prosecuting the case and the Republican president’s defense team. One person watching from the sidelines Wednesday will be Lev Parnas, the indicted associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who wants to testify in the impeachment proceedings. Parnas cannot enter the Senate with his court-ordered electronic-tracking device, but he arrived at the Capitol in late morning. Senators are to submit their written questions to be read by Chief Justice John Roberts. A key question for both sides is whether Trump’s actions rise to the level of “high crimes and misdemeanors,” but that issue is seen through a highly partisan lens on each side. Trump faces charges from Democrats that he abused his power like no other president, jeopardizing U.S.-Ukraine relations by using the military aid as leverage while the vulnerable ally battled Russia. Democrats say Trump then obstructed their probe in a way that threatens the nation’s three-branch system of checks and balances. The president’s legal team tried to lock up its case Tuesday and convince GOP senators that the president was right to ask Ukraine for investigations of Biden and his son Hunter and was well within his power to block the aid. They said he was not bound to abide by the congressional investigation. Trump attorney Jay Sekulow addressed the Bolton controversy head-on in closing arguments by dismissing the former national security adviser’s manuscript as “inadmissible.” Attorney Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard scholar, said earlier that even if Bolton’s story is true the actions don’t rise to an impeachable offense. Senate Republicans spent considerable time in private discussing how to deal with Bolton’s manuscript without extending the proceedings or jeopardizing the president’s expected acquittal. That effort lost steam as Democrats showed no interest, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying, “We’re not bargaining with them.” Some Republicans including Sen. Pat Toomey want reciprocity -- bringing in Bolton or another Democratic witness in exchange for one from the GOP side. Some Republicans want to hear from Biden and his son, who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company when his father was vice president. Those swaps, though, seem likely to fail as most Republican senators don’t want to call Bolton and most Democrats would rather avoid dragging the Bidens further into the impeachment proceedings. The Bidens were a focus of defense arguments though no evidence of wrongdoing has emerged. “I don’t know that the manuscript would make any difference in the outcome of the trial,” said Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of GOP leadership. And some Republicans said they simply don’t trust Bolton’s word. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky called Bolton “disgruntled”’ and seeking to make money off his time at the White house. But John Kelly, Trump’s former White House chief of staff, told an audience in Sarasota, Florida, that he believes Bolton. White House officials privately acknowledge that they are essentially powerless to block the book’s publication but could sue after the fact if they believe it violated the confidentiality agreement Bolton signed. Trump and his lawyers have argued repeatedly that Democrats are using impeachment to try to undo the results of the last presidential election and drive Trump from office. Democrats, meanwhile, say Trump’s refusal to allow administration officials to testify only reinforces that the White House is hiding evidence. The White House has had Bolton’s manuscript for about a month, according to a letter from Bolton’s attorney. Associated Press writers Alan Fram, Mary Clare Jalonick, Andrew Taylor, Matthew Daly, Laurie Kellman and Padmananda Rama contributed to this report.",Associated Press News,"One key Republican, Sen.

Brexit: MEPs say goodbye to UK ahead of Brexit vote - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-51287430,2020-01-29,"Members of the European Parliament are bidding farewell to UK colleagues ahead of a final vote on the Brexit deal. The withdrawal agreement is expected to be signed off at the historic session of the 751-member assembly in Brussels. Some MEPs have marked the occasion with songs - others wore ""always united"" scarves. President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen told the UK: ""We will always love you."" The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday. Ratification of the withdrawal agreement, agreed by the UK and EU in October, is not in doubt after it easily cleared its committee stage last week. Departing British members are expected to be serenaded by their colleagues in a special ceremony after the vote, which is due at 17.00 GMT. The session will see those on either side of the Brexit debate, including the UK's 73 MEPs, celebrate or lament the end of British EU membership. Ahead of the vote, the Parliament's Brexit spokesman, Guy Verhofstadt, said the UK's departure would be a sad occasion for the assembly. ""It's sad to see a country leaving that has twice given its blood to liberate Europe,"" he told the chamber. He added that British MEPs had brought ""wit, charm, and intelligence,"" as well as ""stubbornness"" and would be missed. Mrs von der Leyen says ratification of the withdrawal deal was ""only a first step"" towards a new partnership between the EU and the UK. She says the two should ""join forces"" in areas such as climate change, and seek a close partnership following the UK's exit on Friday - but warned the UK must not attempt to undercut other European nations. The EU president finished her speech by saying: ""We will always love you, and we will not be far. Long live Europe."" Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts said the EU must learn lessons from the UK's decision to leave. He said the bloc had to ""regain the hearts and minds of European citizens"" by focusing on what it could do for the many, not the few. Earlier, the S&D coalition, which houses Labour's 10 MEPs, displayed a sign aimed at departing British members, which read: ""It's not goodbye, it's au revoir."" European Parliament President David Sassoli, also a member of the group, joined the group in a rendition of Auld Lang Syne. On Tuesday evening, several MEPs in the Green group also held a ceremony to mark the UK's departure. Other prominent figures expected to speak include the UK's Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who has been campaigning for the UK's exit since before he was first elected to the Brussels Parliament in 1999. He told reporters earlier he would miss being the assembly's ""pantomime villain,"" but vowed his Brexit Party would not ""vacate the battlefield"". While Brexit Party MEPs spoke of their joy and relief at leaving, others shared messages of sadness on social media as they prepared to vote for the last time. Liberal Democrats shared pictures of gifts from the pro-European Renew Europe group. The Green Party's Alexandra Phillips tweeted: ""I'm devastated to be leaving the best job in the world. I get to make real change every day while being surrounded by 27 different languages and cultures."" The EU's negotiators have kept the European Parliament on board throughout the Brexit process. Its main committees have given their approval. So it's inevitable that the deal will be endorsed. Instead of a moment of jeopardy, this is likely to be the highest profile event in the EU's distinctly low-key goodbye to the UK. Expect speeches that praise EU unity and describe the UK's departure as a regrettable mistake. A German MEP is planning a sing-a-long to Auld Lang Syne. The SNP group have arranged for a piper to play them out of the building. In the meantime, the 73 British members are packing their belongings into their regulation-issue 15 cardboard boxes. The main send-off will happen on Friday, when the president of the European Parliament will deliver a joint statement alongside the presidents of the European Council and the European Commission. The British flag that flutters outside the parliamentary premises will be lowered in the early hours of Saturday morning, before it's displayed in a museum. After the UK leaves, there will be an 11-month transition period in which the two sides hope to negotiate their future economic relationship. Trade talks are expected to begin in earnest in early March. The European Parliament will also get a say in ratifying any future trade deal. The UK has insisted talks should not extend beyond 31 December 2020 when a transition period - which will see the UK follow EU rules - comes to an end. President Sassoli told CNN on Tuesday that the timetable for a deal was tight. He said the UK's exit would be ""painful"" for the bloc but building a new partnership based upon friendly co-operation and mutual interests was now essential. With MEPs set to approve Brexit, the EU Commission president tells the UK: ""We will always love you.""",BBC,"She says the two should ""join forces"" in areas such as climate change, and seek a close partnership following the UK's exit on Friday - but warned the UK must not attempt to undercut other European nations.

Australian Open: Dominic Thiem stuns Rafael Nadal in four-set thriller - BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/51295106,2020-01-29,"Top seed Rafael Nadal was denied a place in the Australian Open semi-finals as Austria's Dominic Thiem rattled the Spaniard with a powerful display to win a four-set thriller. Fifth seed Thiem won 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 4-6 7-6 (8-6) at Melbourne Park. The 26-year-old, beaten by Nadal in the past two French Open finals, missed two match points before taking a third to win in four hours and 10 minutes. He will now face Germany's Alexander Zverev in Friday's last-four match. It will be a first semi-final in Melbourne for both men and the winner will face either Serbia's defending champion Novak Djokovic or Swiss third seed Roger Federer in Sunday's final. Thiem missed the chance to serve out the match at 5-4 in the fourth, becoming jittery with three unforced errors and a double fault as Nadal levelled despite doing little to earn it. But Thiem regrouped to win the third tie-break of a thrilling contest against the 19-time Grand Slam champion. ""I was holding my serve great and then it came to 5-4,"" Thiem said. ""That was a special situation for me, serving against Rafa for a place in the Australian Open semi-finals for the first time. ""It was a mentally tough situation but I turned it around again in the tie-breaker."" Thiem raised both arms in the air when Nadal hit a forehand into the net on the third match point, clutching and shaking his head in what was likely to be a mixture of relief and disbelief. Thiem has long been touted as one of the younger players ready to finally wrestle the sport's biggest prizes from the 'big three' of Nadal, Djokovic and Federer, but he has not consistently challenged them across all four Grand Slams. Known as a clay-court specialist, he has naturally gone closest to fulfilling his potential at the French Open. He has reached the past two finals at Roland Garros, only to be hustled out of the trophy on both occasions by 12-time champion Nadal. But Thiem has shown he also has the game to be successful on hard courts, notably by winning the prestigious Indian Wells title last year. He has now finally proved it on one of the biggest stages against a man who had beaten him in their five previous Grand Slam meetings. Nadal struggled to cope with Thiem's crushing groundstrokes, being worn down in the longer rallies and unable to prevent 65 winners from his opponent. A shank from Nadal on a third break point at 1-1 in the fourth swung momentum back in Thiem's direction, leaving him serving out the match at 5-4. But he tensed up to give hope to the Spaniard that he could take the contest to a fifth set. ""There were demons in the head,"" Thiem said on-court afterwards, by then now able to laugh. ""Everyone has them. ""I was rushing too much and changing tactics from the rest of the match and that was wrong. ""It is tough to handle."" Thiem said he had to ""start from zero"" and was able to recover to win the tense tie-break - but only after spurning his first two match points. The first, on his serve, went begging when he walloped a forehand into the net. There was more drama on the second. Nadal watched a looping return land past the baseline, but it was not called out yet Nadal coolly did not offer a shot, instead simply challenging the call in order to win the point. Thiem was not to be denied at the third attempt, however - a chance which came after another fortunate net-cord worked in his favour. ""I had luck in the right situations, the net cord was on my side,"" Thiem said. ""But it is necessary because he is one of the greatest of all time and you need some luck to beat him."" Thiem earned a measure of revenge on Nadal for his agonising defeat in their only previous meeting on a hard court. That came in the 2018 US Open quarter-finals, with Thiem winning the first set in 24 minutes before succumbing in a five-set epic that lasted almost five hours and finished at 02:00 local time. Nadal showed his mental focus and ability to reset when he needed to most in that New York encounter, but struggled to do that in the first two sets in Melbourne. The 19-time Grand Slam champion looked troubled and paid the price. Thiem's power and execution rattled Nadal, even when the Spaniard led by a break in both sets. The Austrian immediately broke serve to level on both occasions, Nadal missing a set point in the first and coughing up a double fault in the second. ""The ball became so heavy,"" Nadal said. ""With these heavy balls, it's difficult to produce winners sometimes. ""He has a lot of power, so he's able to produce these amazing shots from a very difficult position."" Leading 3-2 in the second set, he was given a time violation by chair umpire Aurelie Tourte for taking too long to serve after winning a brutal 19-shot rally. That led to an irked Nadal telling her: ""You don't like good tennis."" Still unhappy about the incident, Nadal spoke to the tournament supervisor Andreas Egli and later had another disagreement with Tourte over not being allowed to challenge a Thiem serve. He also regularly complained about the cool air blower next to his chair not working properly, with the unit later replaced. All these incidents betrayed Nadal's edginess and, more importantly, translated into his tennis as he missed shots he would normally expect to make at crucial times. Afterwards, however, he said: ""I don't see myself with a negative attitude during the whole match. ""I had a good, positive, fighting spirit all the time. I gave myself an opportunity until the last point."" Analysis and opinion from the BBC's tennis correspondent.

Coronavirus: Denmark in cartoon bust-up with China over flag - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51295225,2020-01-29,"A Danish newspaper has rejected China's demand for an apology after it published a satirical cartoon of a Chinese flag with the five gold stars replaced by the deadly coronavirus. China's embassy in Denmark called the Jyllands-Posten cartoon, published on Monday, ""an insult to China"". The paper and cartoonist Niels Bo Bojesen must ""publicly apologise to the Chinese people"", it said. In 2005 a cartoon of Prophet Muhammad in the paper outraged many Muslims. The coronavirus cartoon furore has spread to social media. Danes have jumped to the defence of Jyllands-Posten on Twitter, while Chinese people have shared social-media memes recalling Denmark's surrender to Nazi Germany in World War Two. That surrender took place within four hours, the tweets say. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen reminded China on Tuesday that ""we have freedom of expression in Denmark - also to draw"". Other Danish politicians stood by the paper's right to publish such a cartoon. The coronavirus crisis gripping China has paralysed transport in and around the province of Hubei, home to about 60 million people. The virus emerged last month in the huge provincial capital, Wuhan. More than 100 people have died. Despite the gravity of the virus threat, Jyllands-Posten chief editor Jacob Nybroe insisted that his paper was not poking fun at the situation. ""We cannot apologise for something we don't think is wrong. We have no intention of being demeaning or to mock, nor do we think that the drawing does. As far as I can see, this here is about different forms of cultural understanding,"" Nybroe said. The Prophet Muhammad cartoon in 2005 triggered fury in the Muslim world.

Kunal Kamra: Airline ban on India comedian sparks fiery debate - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-51291315,2020-01-29,"That is the burning question currently being debated on social media, after four Indian airlines banned Kunal Kamra for his ""altercation"" with Arnab Goswami. Mr Goswami, who runs the Republic news network, is a popular name in India, but is seen as a polarising figure. He frequently berates his panellists, attacks opposition members and government critics, and is also known to pass judgement on news issues -  he has called people names like ""traitor"" and even advocated going to war with Pakistan. The encounter occurred aboard a recent IndiGo airlines flight from Mumbai to Lucknow. Kamra says he met Mr Goswami aboard the plane and ""politely asked him to have a conversation"", but that the journalist had ""pretended to be on a phone call"". After repeatedly trying to ask him questions on journalism, Kamra took the video of him berating Mr Goswami using some of his own catchphrases like ""the nation wants to know!"" He also repeatedly asks ""if Arnab is a coward or a nationalist"". The video quickly went viral - with some quipping that it was the only time they had ever seen Mr Goswami silent. Wearing sunglasses and earphones, he steadfastly ignores Kamra for the entire duration of the video. Hours later, IndiGo Airlines tweeted that it was suspending him, also tagging the aviation minister. @MoCA_GoI @HardeepSPuri In light of the recent incident on board 6E 5317 from Mumbai to Lucknow, we wish to inform that we are suspending Mr. Kunal Kamra from flying with IndiGo for a period of six months, as his conduct onboard was unacceptable behaviour. 1/2 The minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, responded by asking all other airlines to follow suit. So far, the national carrier, Air India, and two other private carriers, SpiceJet and GoAir have responded. Kamra has responded saying ""it's not shocking at all to me that for exercising my right to speech, three airlines have given me a temporary ban."" He pointed out that he was not disruptive on the flight and always followed the orders of the cabin crew, adding that the only ""damage"" he had caused was to Mr Goswami's ""inflated ego"". He wondered why he had been banned from Indigo for six months when no formal complaint had been made against him and also questioned the decision by the other two airlines. Many people on social media are also calling the decision an example of ""blatant double standards"", especially since Mr Goswami's reporters have, in the past, gone up to newsmakers and stridently demanded answers to questions. Among them, was Shashi Tharoor, a leader of the main opposition Congress party, who had been targeted in the past. ""His goons, armed with cameras and mics as their weapons, have done exactly the same thing to me, in almost exactly the same words, on two separate flights until asked to desist by air crew,"" he tweeted. The truth is that it was time someone gave him a taste of his own medicine. These are the words he regularly uses to berate his innocent victims, except he does so in a hectoring, bullying manner & at higher volume & pitch than @kunalkamra88 does in this video. https://t.co/e94B8WcEtj So, basically Kunal Kamra got an airline ban for behaving like Arnab Goswami with Arnab Goswami onboard a flight. Others called the move a ""blatantly political decision"" - they pointed out that a BJP MP who recently created a row aboard a flight was not punished. The hashtag #BoycottIndigo has been trending on Twitter, although some of the tweets have been in support of the ban, calling Kamra a ""nuisance"" and a ""threat to passenger safety"". Mr Kamra, for his part does not seem entirely fazed by his ban, or the criticism that has come his way. Thank you Indigo a six month suspension is honestly very kind of you...Modiji might be suspending Air India forever. https://t.co/ari4erSE5F In a subsequent statement, he said he was ""not sorry""  because he did not think he had done anything ""wrong or criminal"". He also apologised to ""every passenger except one"".

Trump Middle East plan: Palestinians reject 'conspiracy' - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51292865,2020-01-29,"Palestinians have dismissed US President Donald Trump's new Middle East peace plan as a ""conspiracy"". The plan envisages a Palestinian state and the recognition of Israeli sovereignty over West Bank settlements. Mr Trump said Jerusalem would remain Israel's ""undivided"" capital, but the Palestinian capital would ""include areas of East Jerusalem"". Reacting to Tuesday's announcement, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said Jerusalem was ""not for sale"". ""All our rights are not for sale and are not for bargain,"" he added. Thousands of Palestinian protesters held a ""day of rage"" in the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, while the Israeli military deployed reinforcements in the occupied West Bank. The blueprint, which aims to solve one of the world's longest-running conflicts, was drafted under the stewardship of President Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner. Standing alongside Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday, Mr Trump said his proposals ""could be the last opportunity"" for Palestinians. Reports said Mr Netanyahu was planning to press ahead with annexing 30% of the occupied West Bank, with a cabinet vote due on Sunday. Israel has settled about 400,000 Jews in West Bank settlements, with another 200,000 living in East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Speaking on Tuesday, he said it was ""impossible for any Palestinian, Arab, Muslim or Christian child to accept"" a Palestinian state without Jerusalem as its capital. ""We say a thousand times, no, no, no,"" he said. ""We rejected this deal from the start and our stance was correct."" The militant Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, also rejected the deal which it said aimed ""to liquidate the Palestinian national project"". The UN said it remained committed to a two-state solution based on the boundaries in place before the 1967 war, when Israel seized the West Bank and Gaza. The Israeli prime minister described Mr Trump's plan as the ""deal of the century"". Israel ""will not miss this opportunity"", Mr Netanyahu said. ""May God bless us all with security, prosperity and peace!"" he added. A spokesman for UN Secretary General António Guterres called for a peace deal on the basis of UN resolutions, international law and bilateral agreements. The Arab League said it would hold an urgent meeting on Saturday. British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab urged the Palestinians to give the plans ""genuine and fair consideration and explore whether they might prove a first step on the road back to negotiations"". Mr Trump also indicated that the West Bank would not be cut in half under the plan. ""We will also work to create a contiguous territory within the future Palestinian state, for when the conditions for statehood are met, including the firm rejection of terrorism,"" he said. Until now all of the most difficult aspects of an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal - the so-called final status issues - like borders; the future of Israeli settlements in the West Bank; the long-term status of Jerusalem; and the fate of Palestinian refugees, were to be left for face-to-face talks between the Israelis and Palestinians themselves. Not any longer. The deal proposed by President Trump and enthusiastically endorsed by Prime Minister Netanyahu essentially frames all of these issues in Israel's favour. The Palestinians were not just absent from this meeting - they have boycotted the Trump administration ever since it unilaterally moved its embassy to Jerusalem. But they have essentially been presented with an ultimatum - accept the Trump parameters or else, and they have been given some four years to come around. While President Trump is offering the Palestinians a state it would be a much truncated one. No Jewish settlers will be uprooted and Israeli sovereignty will apparently be extended to the settlement blocs and the Jordan Valley. The Palestinians might have a capital in the East Jerusalem suburbs.  This ""take it or leave it offer"" will appal many long-standing students of the region. The question now is not so much what benefit this deal might bring but how much damage it may do by over-turning Palestinian aspirations. The Palestinians broke off contacts with the Trump administration in December 2017, after Mr Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the US embassy to the city from Tel Aviv. Since then, the US has ended both bilateral aid for Palestinians and contributions for the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). In November, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US had abandoned its four-decades-old position that Jewish settlements in the West Bank were inconsistent with international law. Of all the conflicts in the Middle East, that between Israel and the Palestinians has been the most intractable. Although the two sides signed a peace accord in 1993, more than a quarter of a century on they are arguably as far apart as ever. Jerusalem: Both Israel and the Palestinians hold competing claims to the city. Israel, which occupied the formerly Jordanian-held eastern part in 1967, regards the whole of Jerusalem as its capital. The Palestinians insist on East Jerusalem - home to about 350,000 of their community - as their future capital Palestinian statehood: The Palestinians want an independent state of their own, comprising the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. Israeli prime ministers have publicly accepted the notion of a Palestinian state alongside Israel - but not what form it should take. Benjamin Netanyahu has said any Palestinian state should be demilitarised with the powers to govern itself but not to threaten Israel. Recognition: Israel insists that any peace deal must include Palestinian recognition of it as the ""nation-state of the Jewish people"", arguing that without this Palestinians will continue to press their own national claims to the land, causing the conflict to endure. The Palestinians say what Israel calls itself is its own business, but to recognise it as the Jewish state will discriminate against Israel's Arab population of Palestinian origin, who are Muslims, Christians and Druze. Borders: Both sides have fundamentally different ideas as to where the boundaries of a potential Palestinian state should be. The Palestinians insist on borders based on ceasefire lines which separated Israel and East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza between 1949 and 1967. Israel says those lines are militarily indefensible and were never intended to be permanent. It has not said where borders should be, other than making clear its own eastern border should be along the Jordan River. Settlements: Since 1967, Israel has built about 140 settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, as well as 121 outposts - settlements built without the government's authorisation. Settlements are considered illegal by most of the international community, though Israel disputes this. Palestinians say all settlements must be removed for a Palestinian state to be viable. Mr Netanyahu has vowed not only to never to uproot any settlements but to bring them under Israeli sovereignty. Refugees: The UN says its agencies support about 5.5 million Palestinian refugees in the Middle East (the Palestinian Authority says there are up to 6 million), including the descendants of people who fled or were expelled by Jewish forces from what became Israel in the 1948-49 war. Palestinians insist on their right to return to their former homes, but Israel says they are not entitled to, noting that such a move would overwhelm it demographically and lead to its end as a Jewish state.

The order came in the wake of controversial comments by the MPs against thousands of largely Muslim women who have been staging a demonstration in Shaheen Bagh - a Muslim-dominated neighbourhood in the capital, Delhi. Elections will be held there on 8 February. The polls pit the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which runs India's government, against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which governs Delhi. The AAP, headed by charismatic chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, is hoping to return to power, pointing to its record on affordable healthcare, education, electricity and water. The BJP has accused the protesters of being ""traitors"" to India. The charge levelled at the women protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) has been led by the home minister, BJP president Amit Shah. He told supporters to press the button for the BJP with ""so much anger that protesters in Shaheen Bagh feel the current"". Other party leaders have followed suit. Anurag Thakur, the junior finance minister, was censured by the election commission after he incited the crowd at an election rally to shout ""shoot the traitors"" while railing against those at Shaheen Bagh. He defended his comments by saying he was merely reflecting the ""mood of Delhi"". Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, said the men of Shaheen Bagh were sending their women out to protest while they stayed home and slept, because they were too afraid to come out themselves. Yet another minister, Parvesh Varma, swore the protesters would be ""sent packing"" within hours of a BJP victory, adding that if left unchecked, they would ""rape and kill"". Other party members have called the election a battle between ""India and Pakistan"", which critics have denounced as a clear attempt to stigmatise Muslims. Residents, mostly Muslim women, have been staging a continuous sit-in on a public road for more than a month. Videos from Shaheen Bagh show women singing songs, clapping and passing tea and food to one another. It has been a rare moment - one of the few times anyone can remember India's Muslim women coming out in such large numbers and leading a movement of this nature, although many others from different religions have sat alongside them in solidarity. They have read each other the preamble of India's constitution, made speeches reaffirming their citizenship and sung patriotic songs. Shaheen Bagh has captured the imagination of many Indians. The peaceful nature of the demonstrations have been in stark contrast to other protests against the citizenship law in which more than 30 people have been killed - most of them in Uttar Pradesh state - and the police accused of brutality. The BJP for its part has painted the Shaheen Bagh protesters as extremists, who are seeking to break the country apart with the support of the AAP and its leader, Arvind Kejriwal. The act offers amnesty to non-Muslim illegal immigrants from three neighbouring Muslim-majority countries. It amends India's 64-year-old citizenship law, which currently prohibits illegal migrants from becoming Indian citizens. It also expedites the path to Indian citizenship for members of six religious communities - Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian - if they can prove they are from Pakistan, Afghanistan or Bangladesh. They will now only have to live or work in India for six years - instead of 11 years - before becoming eligible to apply for citizenship. Under the CAA people holding Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards could lose their right to live and work in India indefinitely if they break local laws, no matter how minor the offence. Several petitions argue that the law is illegal, claiming that it grants citizenship on the basis of religion - which goes against the country's secular values enshrined in its constitution. Those challenging it include political parties, civil society and Muslim groups. Adding to the fears is a government pledge to carry out a widespread exercise to weed out ""infiltrators"" from neighbouring countries. Many Muslim citizens fear they could be made stateless, given that the exercise relies on extensive documentation to prove their ancestors lived in India. The government has defended the law, saying it will give sanctuary to people fleeing religious persecution and Mr Shah has vowed that it will not be rolled back. ""What the BJP is trying to do is very clear. Polarisation is a tried and tested method that has won them elections in the past. But the million dollar question is, will it also work in Delhi?"" political commentator Neerja Chowdhury told the BBC. Many critics have said the protesters are an easy target for the Hindu nationalist BJP, as they are largely Muslim, and have said they demonstrate precisely why Muslims are afraid of the CAA. The BJP comments have also caused a stir on social media. Although there are some who agree with the criticisms against the protesters, many say it is a clear indication the BJP has been rattled by Shaheen Bagh. AAP supporters say the BJP's tactics show how desperate the party is to avoid defeat. The hashtag #KejriwalAgainstEntireBJP was the top India trend on Tuesday afternoon. Ms Chowdhury said that although it was expected the BJP would come out strongly as the election drew nearer, she was still surprised by the tone of the campaign. ""We have had many lows in Indian politics and electioneering. But I don't ever remember a legislator telling people that they would be raped and killed,"" she said.

Coronavirus: Britons on Wuhan flights to be quarantined - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-51292590,2020-01-29,"Hundreds of British citizens being flown back to the UK from Wuhan on Thursday will be put in quarantine for two weeks. It comes as British Airways suspends all direct flights to and from mainland China because of the coronavirus outbreak. Australia, Japan, the US and EU nations are also repatriating citizens. The virus has caused more than 130 deaths, spreading across China and to at least 16 other countries. The UK government plans to fly 200 British citizens out from Wuhan, the centre of the new coronavirus outbreak. On arrival, they will be put in ""supported isolation"" for 14 days with ""all necessary medical attention"", a Downing Street spokesman said. He said the government would confirm the location they will be held in due course but offered no comment on reports it would be a military base. ""Our priority is to keep British nationals and their families together,"" he added. Those returning from other parts of China will not be affected, but have been advised to ""self-isolate"" for 14 days. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will chair a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee at 16:30 GMT. Australia plans to quarantine its 600 returning citizens for two weeks on Christmas Island - some 2,000km (1,200 miles) from the mainland. British Airways, which operates daily flights to Shanghai and Beijing from Heathrow, announced the suspension of flights to and from mainland China ""with immediate effect"" until 31 January while it assesses the situation. A statement said: ""We apologise to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority."" Other airlines, including United Airlines, Air Canada and Cathay Pacific Airways, have already cancelled some flights to China. Some Britons in Wuhan said they had not been told about the quarantine plan, with one man having refused his place on the flight for fear of spreading the disease. Kharn Lambert told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that the embassy said it is their own responsibility to arrange transport home and isolate themselves. ""I don't want to put the health of regular, everyday British citizens at risk,"" he said. British lecturer Yvonne Griffiths, who is currently in a hotel in Wuhan, said she was told in the early hours of Wednesday morning that there would be a flight from Wuhan airport to the UK. ""We have to be there six to seven hours before the flight leaves, and we would have a screening from some health people here in Wuhan, and if we are not showing any symptoms then we'll be able to board that plane,"" she said. ""If we were to be suffering temperature or any other symptoms, breathing problems, then there seems to be a possibility of quarantining at this end."" Another British man, Jeff Siddle, from Northumberland, said that he and his daughter had been offered seats on a flight on Thursday - but not his wife, who's a Chinese national. China is not allowing its citizens to leave the country. The number of deaths from the virus has risen to 132 in China, the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) said on Wednesday. Four cases have been confirmed in Germany, making it the second European country to report cases, after France. The United Arab Emirates has also confirmed its first cases of the virus in a family who recently returned to the UAE from Wuhan. In the UK, the Department of Health said on Wednesday that 130 people had been given the all-clear for the virus. An expert from the NHC said it could take 10 more days for the outbreak to peak. Like the similar Sars and influenza viruses, the new coronavirus is a particular risk for elderly people and those with pre-existing illnesses. The sharp rise in cases is in part attributed to increased awareness, monitoring and testing in recent days. One theory is that the virus, which can cause severe acute respiratory infection, may have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. There is no specific cure or vaccine. A number of people, however, have recovered after treatment. United Airlines has cancelled 24 US flights to Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai between 1 and 8 February because of a sharp drop in demand. Cathay Pacific said it would cut flights to China from 30 January to the end of March, while Air Canada has also reduced its number of flights. Indonesia's Lion Air said it would be temporarily suspending flights from Saturday, affecting dozens of flights on routes to 15 Chinese cities. Russia's Ural Airlines said it had suspended some services to Europe popular with Chinese tourists, including Paris and Rome, because of the outbreak. Other airlines are introducing measures aimed at reducing the chances of spreading the virus. Taiwan's China Airlines said it was encouraging passengers to bring their own beverage bottles, while Singapore Airlines was among those allowing crew to wear masks on China flights. New Zealand will cooperate with Canberra to bring its 53 citizens home alongside the Australian evacuees. Some 200 Japanese nationals have been flown from Wuhan and have landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Around 650 others said they wanted to be repatriated, and the Japanese government said new flights were being planned. According to Japanese media, several of the returnees were suffering from fever or coughs. All will be taken to hospital, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms. Also on Wednesday, 240 Americans - including workers the local US consulate - left the city. According to CNN, the evacuees might have to stay in isolation in an airport hangar for up to two weeks. Separately, two aircraft to fly EU citizens home were scheduled, with 250 French nationals leaving on the first flight. South Korea said some 700 of its citizens would leave on four flights this week. Both Malaysia and the Philippines also said they would evacuate their citizens in and around Wuhan. Meanwhile, Hong Kong announced plans to slash cross-border travel between the city and mainland China. Have you been affected by any of the issues raised?

Villages on Beijing’s outskirts isolate selves amid outbreak,https://apnews.com/805ec38b50cb9f10cbe48fedfe010758,2020-01-29,"BEIJING (AP) — With barricades and wary guardians, villages on the outskirts of Beijing are closing themselves off to outsiders to ward against infection from a new type of virus. Roads are being blocked by piles of earth or anything else capable of stopping traffic, red banners are tied overhead and serious-looking villagers wearing masks and red armbands stand guard to prevent outsiders and their vehicles from entering. Those wishing to visit have to prove their presence is necessary and testify that they have not traveled to Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, or other stricken areas. “If we let in one (infected) person, the whole village would be ruined,” said Chen Shuyi, a member of the village committee in Zhuangke in Hebei province, which borders Beijing. At the entrance to another village, Donggouhe, an electric screen displays a message from the local governing committee: “No gathering, no visiting, prevent infection.” “We’ve made it very clear that people and cars from outside cannot get into the village,” said committee head Wang Huijin. “Hopefully this can protect our people and also this can help the country.” Li Shulin, committee head of Datun village, said every similar-sized community in the region is employing the same tactics, and that this year’s Lunar New Year, which began last week, has a very different feel from previous years. “People stopped paying new year visits. Most of them stayed at home,” he said. The new type of coronavirus has killed 132 people and infected more than 6,000 on the mainland and abroad. The latest figures cover the previous 24 hours and add 26 to the number of deaths, 25 of which were in the central province of Hubei and its capital, Wuhan. The 5,974 cases on the mainland marked a rise of 1,459 from the previous day, although that rise is a smaller increase than the 1,771 new cases reported on Monday. Dozens of infections have been confirmed abroad as well. The village closures echo tactics employed during the outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, in 2002-2003. SARS, which also originated in China and killed nearly 800 people, hit Beijing especially hard.

"Berlin film fest to zoom in on inner turmoil, outer chaos ",https://apnews.com/1951bf72a27c12897f93b935576b40c1,2020-01-29,"BERLIN (AP) — This year’s Berlin International Film Festival will have a decidedly dark focus, with many of its headline movies reflecting the inner turmoil of characters and the troubled backdrop of the chaotic world around them. The festival’s new artistic director, Carlo Chatrian, said Wednesday that while the 70th Berlinale will feature some comedies, “a good number of films in the competition decided to look at the dark side of the human being.” “They are not without hope, but at the same time they want to really face what’s happening around us,” he said. “Sometimes talking about the inner fear. Sometimes talking about the fear that’s in the world outside us.” Among the 18 movies competing for the festival’s top Golden Bear award are “The Roads Not Taken,” a father-daughter drama directed by Sally Potter and featuring Javier Bardem, Elle Fanning, Salma Hayek, Laura Linney; a remake of “Berlin Alexanderplatz” that moves the Weimar-era setting to the present; and Abel Ferrara’s experimental “Siberia” featuring Willem Dafoe and Dounia Sichov. The three films will have their world premieres in Berlin, while Disney/Pixar’s new animated movie “Onward” will be shown internationally for the first time in the German capital.

GOP squirms as Bolton prepares to dish on Trump White House,https://apnews.com/cc7316d191075ac57e0bcd34f05d70b4,2020-01-29,"WASHINGTON (AP) — For much of the last 20 years, John Bolton was a conservative poster child, a Republican hawk whose worldview helped shape the GOP establishment’s approach to dicey foreign policy questions. Now, as President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser prepares to dish on his days in the White House, some old friends and colleagues are turning on him — and others are nervously wondering what he may be poised to reveal. Leaked passages from the manuscript of Bolton’s soon-to-be published book are roiling Washington, including the revelation that he says Trump told him he was conditioning the release of military aid to Ukraine on whether its government would help investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. Bolton’s roughly 17-month tenure in as national security adviser brought him rare access to the inner workings of the West Wing and the Cabinet, particularly on matters of global affairs. He was known to take copious notes on yellow legal pads. After this week’s early leaks about the book, White House aides and allies are privately expressing concern about what more Bolton might reveal that the president and others in his orbit would find embarrassing. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., gave voice to GOP pique about Bolton’s revelations in an interview with Fox News. He said Bolton had long argued for expansive executive powers to protect a president’s conversations with his advisers but “now he’s going to argue that no, no, no, now that I have a book deal for a couple of million bucks, that it’s OK for me to say and spill the beans on everything the president’s said to me privately.” Less than two years ago, Rep. Mark Meadows, a North Carolina Republican and Trump impeachment team manager, praised the president for bringing Bolton into the White House, saying the president “could not have made a better pick” for the key role in the administration. Bolton, who served as United Nations ambassador in the George W. Bush administration, was a fierce advocate for the 2003 war in Iraq and has pushed for military action in Iran, North Korea and Venezuela. But this week, following news reports that Bolton made damaging charges about Trump in the forthcoming book, Meadows questioned why Democrats were treating Bolton as some sort of potential “super witness” to make their case in the impeachment trial. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, earlier this month said Bolton’s testimony “could well be beneficial” to Trump in the impeachment trial. But after this week’s leaks about the book, Cornyn questioned whether there would be much value in hearing from Bolton, saying “it’s nothing different than what we’ve already heard.” Democrats are pressing for Bolton to be called as a witness in the Senate trial, but need the support of at least four Republican senators to make it a reality. Only a few GOP senators have suggested they may be interested. Fred Fleitz, a former chief of staff on Trump’s National Security Council and a friend of Bolton, wrote in an opinion article for Fox’s website that Bolton’s decision to write a “tell-all” was “crushing” and urged him to withdraw it from his publisher immediately. “I don’t understand the need for a former National Security Adviser to publish a tell-all book critical of a president he served, especially during a presidential reelection campaign that will determine the fate of the country,” Fleitz wrote. “There will be a time for Bolton to speak out without appearing to try to tip a presidential election.” Trump himself has disputed Bolton’s assertion of a concerted pressure campaign on Ukraine’s leader. And Trump has dismissed Bolton as a disgruntled employee whom he fired because of policy differences. Bolton, who left the White House last year, insists he offered his resignation before Trump announced his ouster. Trump jabbed at Bolton in a tweet Wednesday, referring to his former adviser as the “guy who couldn’t get approved for the Ambassador to the U.N. years ago” and accusing him of “mistakes of judgment.” Bolton is well-known for his hard-line policy views against Iran and North Korea. Bush installed Bolton as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. through what is known as a “recess appointment” when the Senate was out of session. He stepped down at the end of that appointment because he was unlikely to win Senate confirmation, largely due to his foreign policy vision. In the tweet, Trump also complained that Bolton, after he was fired, “goes out and IMMEDIATELY writes a nasty & untrue book. All Classified National Security. Who would do this?” Trump allies, including personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and 2016 campaign adviser Jason Miller, slammed Bolton and said he was being untruthful in order to drive up book sales and remain relevant. “There is no way in the world President Trump would say this to John Bolton,” Giuliani tweeted. “It’s a shame that a man will sacrifice his integrity to make a few bucks on a book. No wonder he accomplished so little as National Security Advisor.” In an interview scheduled for airing Wednesday on “CBS This Morning,” Giuliani called Bolton a “backstabber.” As Trump’s legal team has presented the president’s defense this week, it has made the case that Trump never conditioned aid on an investigation of the Bidens. The president’s lawyers have also argued that even if Trump had pressed for the investigation, it doesn’t rise to level of an impeachable offense. In a sideswipe at Bolton, one of Trump’s attorneys, Jay Sekulow, argued Tuesday that senators cannot impeach a president on an “unsourced allegation.” Administration officials have also sought to undercut another revelation from the Bolton manuscript, one reported Monday by The New York Times. It said Bolton told Attorney General William Barr last year that he had concerns that Trump was effectively granting personal favors to the leaders of Turkey and China. According to the manuscript, Barr told Bolton he was worried Trump was creating the appearance that he had undue influence over independent Justice Department probes. The Justice Department has disputed the assertion that there was any discussion of personal favors or undue influence on investigations. The department also disputes that Barr ever said the president’s conversations with foreign leaders were inappropriate. “If this is truly what Mr. Bolton has written, then it seems he is attributing to Attorney General Barr his own current views — views with which Attorney General Barr does not agree,” Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said in a statement. Others are standing by Bolton. John Kelly, who served as Trump’s chief of staff and overlapped with Bolton in the White House, said Monday in Florida that he believes the former national security adviser’s account, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported. “If John Bolton says that in the book, I believe John Bolton,” Kelly said. Associated Press Writers Zeke Miller in Washington and Michael Balsamo in New York contributed to this report.",Associated Press News,"He said Bolton had long argued for expansive executive powers to protect a president’s conversations with his advisers but “now he’s going to argue that no, no, no, now that I have a book deal for a couple of million bucks, that it’s OK for me to say and spill the beans on everything the president’s said to me privately.” Less than two years ago, Rep.

Cultural landmarks such as the Great Wall and Forbidden City have closed their doors to visitors. Nearly deserted shopping malls have reduced their operating hours, and those restaurants that remain open draw just a handful of customers. Streets and subway stations are empty. The government has extended the holiday period, giving everyone three additional days off. But at what is usually one of the busiest periods for tourism, most seem to be using the extra vacation to hunker down at home.

Actors’ union issues standards for supervisors of sex scenes,https://apnews.com/7223ea603c7006f72e891ac7f11647d1,2020-01-29,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The union that represents actors and television performers issued a series of standards and guidelines Wednesday for crew members who supervise scenes involving sex and nudity. The goal is to combat on-set sexual harassment. The framework announced by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists provides a common set of policies and practices for so-called ``intimacy coordinators″ to help productions and actors navigate sexually sensitive scenes. Under the guidelines, intimacy coordinators should have pre-production meetings with producers, directors and writers to establish the exact degrees of nudity expected and the specifics of simulated sex as established in scripts. They should have one-on-one meetings with actors to be clear about what they consent to. “These protocols and guidelines will help to normalize and encourage the use of intimacy coordinators in productions, therefore ensuring the safety and security of SAG-AFTRA members while they work,” union President Gabrielle Carteris said in a statement. The guidelines say that on set, intimacy coordinators should review the so-called “modesty garments” and physical barriers used during simulations of onscreen sex, and be familiar with ways to help directors choreograph the scenes in ways that can keep them believable and artistic without sacrificing the dignity or safety of performers. The guidelines, drawn up by a team of leaders from the union, actors and intimacy coordinators, directly address the problem of sexual harassment on sets, the union’s National Executive Director David White said in a statement. Deviations from the standards do not carry enforcement penalties. Amanda Blumenthal, founder of the Intimacy Professionals Association, helped create the guidelines and said in a statement that they “strike the right balance between describing the roles and responsibilities of intimacy coordinators while still allowing for flexibility from show-to-show.” The move is the latest of several made by SAG-AFTRA during the #MeToo era in an attempt to fight sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct aimed at actors. They include the adoption in 2018 of a code of conduct, which says among other things that auditions and similar professional meetings should not be held in hotel rooms or homes.",Associated Press News,"Amanda Blumenthal, founder of the Intimacy Professionals Association, helped create the guidelines and said in a statement that they “strike the right balance between describing the roles and responsibilities of intimacy coordinators while still allowing for flexibility from show-to-show.” The move is the latest of several made by SAG-AFTRA during the #MeToo era in an attempt to fight sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct aimed at actors.

Priests in group shut down by Vatican accused of sex abuse,https://apnews.com/9e502dedcd0b98999e1db829bfea6efe,2020-01-29,"VATICAN CITY (AP) — Nine priests and brothers of a Catholic group recently shut down by the Vatican are under investigation by Italian authorities for allegedly sexually abusing two brothers, officials and news reports said Wednesday. Prato Bishop Giovanni Nerbini confirmed that Prato criminal prosecutors had opened an investigation after he reported the case to police against members of the Disciples of the Annunciation community. He pledged the church’s cooperation with the investigation. The Vatican in December officially dissolved the Disciples, a Prato-based, diocesan-approved association of the faithful, after two successive Vatican investigations uncovered a host of problems and members fled the group. The Vatican has closed or taken over several of these new associations and Catholic movements in recent years after a variety of abuses emerged, including sexual abuse and abuse of authority by their often-charismatic leaders. The Prato daily La Nazione said the nine under investigation for sex abuse included five priests, a brother and three religious order priests. The Italian church has only recently begun to reckon with the problem of clergy abuse after years of covering it up and denying that it was a problem. Nerbini’s press conference was unusual, suggesting that Italian bishops were beginning to deal with the sex abuse scandal more transparently and actively reporting cases to police. Clergy are not mandated to report child sex abuse in Italy. Victims have long demanded that the Italian hierarchy compel bishops and religious superiors to report suspected abuse to police even without the legal requirement. The diocese of Prato put out a press release noting that Nerbini on his own brought the case to Prato authorities in December. His predecessor had not done so when he received the victim’s complaint in June, reporting it only to the Vatican as required under the Catholic Church’s in-house canon law. A canonical investigation is under way as well, Nerbini said.",Associated Press News,"Nerbini’s press conference was unusual, suggesting that Italian bishops were beginning to deal with the sex abuse scandal more transparently and actively reporting cases to police.

Fight over Bolton gives Romney a chance for Senate clout,https://apnews.com/e08720b63e5f67571adf9bacc8220267,2020-01-29,"WASHINGTON (AP) — It’s Mitt Romney’s big moment, again. The 2012 Republican presidential nominee has for a year been a freshman senator from Utah. He’s sitting in judgment of the president he has called unfit for office. And he’s defying President Donald Trump by calling for one witness in particular, former national security adviser John Bolton, as the Senate weighs the impeachment allegations against the nation’s 45th president. The trial is a chance for Romney to build influence in the Senate as an independent GOP voice — or become one of the Republicans standing by the president when it’s time to be counted. Votes, not words of concern about the president’s behavior, are what matter most. For now, the Utah senator has been clear about wanting more than the manuscript of Bolton’s book, which alleges that Trump directly linked the release of military aid to Ukraine’s willingness to investigate Democrats. “I’d rather hear from Mr. Bolton,” Romney, 72, told reporters on Tuesday. He may yet get the chance. On Tuesday night, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republicans in a closed session that they lacked the 51 votes to block the 100-member Senate from calling any witnesses. A motion to call them would pass if Romney and at least three other Republicans voted with all Democrats. It’s far from clear whether Bolton or other witnesses end up testifying before the Senate, or whether Romney, in the end, votes with other Republicans to acquit Trump. Right now, Romney is focused on witnesses, not party, said Jason Perry, director of the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah. “I don’t believe that he believes he has broken ranks with the party,” Perry said. “I believe he thinks he is helping the party, because he believes he is fulfilling the constitutional role of being an unbiased juror.” The vote math is one of the factors that makes impeachment a rich opportunity for Romney to elevate his status as a rare independent voice in the Trump-dominated Republican Party. Another is the fact that Romney is as safe as a Republican can be under the payback-loving president. He isn’t up for reelection for nearly five years. Utah is polarized over Trump, but not between Republicans and Democrats. Even as “Never Trumpers” have faded nationally, a strong current of discomfort with the president remains in polite, immigrant-welcoming Utah. Also, Romney has survived Trump’s attacks, some profane, before. Trump used crude terms to describe Romney’s appeal for an endorsement in 2012. In the heat of the 2016 GOP presidential primary, Romney delivered a speech in which he said Trump “lacks the temperament to be president,” is a “fraud” and, on an assortment of issues, is “very, very not smart.” Trump never forgot it. Victory in hand over Democrat Hillary Clinton, Trump said he was considering nominating Romney for secretary of state. Romney met him for an awkward dinner that produced awkward photographs. Later, Trump said he never really considered Romney for the post. “Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous ‘ass’ who has been fighting me from the beginning,” Trump tweeted last year. Asked last week whether he can really be unbiased after that last crack, Romney dismissed it as irrelevant. Going against Trump is “a risk for any Republican. Mitt Romney is familiar with that. He can handle it,” said Sarah Longwell, executive director of Republicans for the Rule of Law. She said the group is spending more than $1 million on ads this week calling for witnesses. But in contrast to the ads in places like Colorado, where Republican Sen. Cory Gardner is in a tight reelection race, the ads running in Utah aren’t focused on just Romney, Longwell said. One goal, she said, is to “educate his constituents” on why he wants witnesses to testify. “This is Ambassador John Bolton,” intones the narrator over a photo of Bolton with his mouth taped shut. “Are Senate Republicans willing to do their duty to listen?” There’s been a bit of blowback, influenced like everything else about impeachment by the looming 2020 election. Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., tweeted Monday that Romney “wants to appease the left by calling witnesses who will slander” the president. She included Trump’s Twitter handle, in an effort to ensure he saw her support. By Wednesday it seemed clear why: Rep. Doug Collins, one of the president’s top defenders during the House impeachment proceedings, announced he was challenging her for the seat. “We’re ready for a good time down here to keep defending this president,” Collins said on Fox News Channel’s “ Fox & Friends.” Inside the Senate, Romney is part of the whip, or vote-counting, team. But there’s scant evidence that he’s giving, or getting, any lobbying about witnesses. After the defense rested on Tuesday, Senate Republican whip John Thune ambled over to Romney’s seat in the back row, two chairs from the corner, just before the big meeting in McConnell’s office. The two chatted for a few seconds. The president’s defense team has showed little if any interest in pressing Romney on the Senate floor. And an official close to the senator said there is no lobbying effort afoot on Romney’s part. Romney’s conduct in the chamber would seem to support that. He’s mostly sat, or stood by his chair, taking notes and occasionally chatting with seatmates Mike Braun of Indiana and Dan Sullivan of Alaska. Romney is famously a sticker for rules. Technically, only water and milk are allowed on the Senate floor. On Tuesday, Romney was seen with a bottle of chocolate milk, from the Brigham Young University creamery. But a bottle is against the rules. He was later seen with what looked like chocolate milk in a glass. Associated Press writer Lindsay Whitehurst in Salt Lake City contributed to this report.

Syria war: Army 'recaptures' key town from opposition in Idlib - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-51293327,2020-01-29,"The Syrian army says it has recaptured the strategic town of Maarat al-Numan in Idlib province, the opposition's last stronghold. State media reported that troops had ""liberated"" the town after inflicting heavy losses on jihadist fighters. A monitoring group earlier said the opposition had withdrawn. Maarat al-Numan straddles a major highway that has been an objective for the army as it has pressed ahead with an offensive in Idlib in recent weeks. Hundreds of thousands of civilians, the vast majority of them women and children, have fled the fighting and moved towards the border with Turkey, where they are struggling to cope in camps and makeshift shelters. Syria's army says it took control of Maarat al-Numan after heavy clashes with fighters from a jihadist alliance known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that dominates opposition-held Idlib. The jihadists eventually withdrew to the north, towards Saraqeb and Ariha, it added. A reporter for the Sana state-run news agency said troops were patrolling neighbourhoods on Wednesday morning, dismantling mines and booby-trapped vehicles, and clearing tunnels. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that opposition forces had withdrawn from Maarat al-Numan on Tuesday , and that since Friday pro-government forces had seized 25 other villages and towns with the support of Russian air power. At least 147 pro-government fighters and 151 opposition fighters had been killed in that time, it said. The UN said on Tuesday that at least 1,506 civilians had been killed in violence since the end of April, when there was an upsurge in fighting in Idlib and surrounding areas of Aleppo and Hama provinces. The region is home to some three million people, 76% of whom are women and children. At least 358,000 people have fled their homes since violence escalated at the start of December. The UN warned that the latest influx of displaced people had added to a dire humanitarian situation. More than 400,000 people were displaced between the end of April and the end of August. Conditions on the ground have been further exacerbated by extreme winter weather, including flooding and freezing temperatures, and rising fuel prices. There is also a shortage of medical supplies and functioning medical facilities. At least 50 health facilities have been attacked in Idlib in the past year. With MEPs set to approve Brexit, the EU Commission president tells the UK: ""We will always love you.""",BBC,"The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that opposition forces had withdrawn from Maarat al-Numan on Tuesday , and that since Friday pro-government forces had seized 25 other villages and towns with the support of Russian air power.

BBC News to close 450 posts as part of £80m savings drive - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-51271168,2020-01-29,"Around 450 jobs will be cut from BBC News under plans to complete its £80m savings target by 2022. Outlets to be hit by job closures include BBC Two's Newsnight, BBC Radio 5 Live and the World Update programme on the World Service. BBC News boss Fran Unsworth said there had to be a move away from traditional broadcasting and towards digital. But broadcasting union Bectu said the changes mean staff will be ""under even more pressure to deliver"". The job cuts announced on Wednesday include the previously announced closure of BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme. BBC News currently employs around 6,000 people, including 1,700 outside the UK. Its budget after the changes will be around £480m per year. Unsworth, who is director of BBC News, said: ""The BBC has to face up to the changing way audiences are using us. ""We need to reshape BBC News for the next decade in a way which saves substantial amounts of money. We are spending too much of our resources on traditional linear broadcasting and not enough on digital."" The corporation announced in 2016 that it needed to save £800m, with around £80m of that figure coming from News. Just over £40m - around half - of the savings required in BBC News have already been found over the past four years. The remaining savings will be found in large part by restructuring the newsroom to adopt a ""story-led"" model, which will see planned stories each rolled out across a greater number of programmes and outlets. The BBC said this would avoid the duplication that occurs from several programmes putting resources into the same news stories. However, the changes mean there will be a reduction in the overall number of stories covered, and Newsnight will produce fewer films. The corporation said further information about which specific jobs are to go will be announced early in the summer. Unsworth also said there would be a review of the number of presenters BBC News has and how they work. While Victoria Derbyshire and World Update will be closed, Unsworth said there are unlikely to be any further closures of entire programmes or services. The savings are expected to result in post closures across BBC News as the planning and commissioning of stories is centralised. The BBC News website will be largely, although not entirely, protected, as the corporation prepares to invest further in digital, including the launch of a new version of the BBC News app. The 450 job cuts include around 50 post closures at the World Service that were announced at the end of 2019. The BBC announced in 2016 it needed to save £800m by 2020; BBC News was to provide £80m of those savings, and it is only half way. The BBC is struggling to connect with many British people - especially those from poorer socio-economic backgrounds, and - even more so - those under 35. The licence fee, which accounts for around 75% of the BBC's revenue, is under unprecedented political and structural pressure. These three facts have driven the changes announced today. The first made pain inevitable; the second has determined the nature of the cuts announced; the third means the audience the BBC has in mind when making these changes isn't just licence fee payers - it's the inhabitants of 10 Downing Street. Writing on Twitter after the latest announcement, Victoria Derbyshire took issue with the reasons behind the decision to close her programme. ""We were NEVER asked to grow the linear TV audience. Ever,"" she tweeted in response to a journalist who suggested the viewing figures for her programme were low. ""We were asked to grow our digital audience - we did,"" she said. Michelle Stanistreet, general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, responded to the announcement by saying: ""These damaging cuts are part of an existential threat to the BBC, and a direct consequence of the last disastrous, secret licence fee deal the BBC agreed with the government."" Bectu national secretary Noel McClean said: ""The unprecedented constraints faced by the BBC will leave our members under even more pressure to deliver the output and service that has made this essential public service the envy of the international broadcasting community and risks its future viability."" Damian Collins MP, who is standing for re-election as chair of the House of Commons culture select committee, said there would be ""concerns"" about the plans. ""They should explain how it'll impact the BBC's ability to reach people,"" he wrote on Twitter. TalkRadio host Julia Hartley Brewer and former Newsnight economics editor Paul Mason were among those offering their views on the plans on Twitter. My sympathies go to every BBC journalist who faces losing their job today and I wish them the best in finding new work. But, as a taxpayer-funded organisation, the absurd over-staffing at the BBC simply cannot be justified anymore. There is no reason for BBC output to suffer.

What's wrong with Fran Unsworth's vision for BBC News: 1) Any editorial graphic where ""original journalism"" is in the bottom corner is a recipe for News becoming an announcement board for business, the monarchy and the state... pic.twitter.com/Bx8COENog5 Meanwhile, the BBC has suspended the closure of its Red Button text service after protests, a day before it was due to have started being phased out. On Monday, a petition calling for it to be saved, organised by the National Federation of the Blind of the UK (NFBUK), was handed in to the BBC and Downing Street.

Hotel design trends: Lobbies and rooms with a point of view,https://apnews.com/527b0fcd964a4897bc62e9268f3bb1c1,2020-01-29,"Designers of hotel spaces have traditionally tended to favor either theatrical flair (baroque finishes and opulent flourishes) or the opposite: a low-key insouciance consisting of neutral, contemporary furniture and acres of beige-ness. That’s changing. Now, many designers are looking to the cities and neighborhoods where hotels are located for decorating inspiration. The vibe inside is skewed more ``living room’’ than ``lobby.’’ And in the rooms, gallery walls are supplanting generic landscape prints, and there might be the kinds of objets d’art, reading materials and soft furnishings one would have at home. “We’ve heard from our showrooms and exhibitors that they’re seeing an uptick in ‘softer’-style solutions for spaces like hotel lobbies,” says Byron Morton, vice president of leasing for NeoCon, the commercial design industry exhibition held annually in Chicago. “The lobby is increasingly a communal meeting and amenity space rather than just a pass-through.” Tom Parker, co-founder of the design group Fettle, which has offices in London and Los Angeles, says changes in how business travelers work have impacted both the public and private spaces in a hotel. “New technology has paved the way for the ‘gig economy’ and freelancing. People are now working flexible hours from locations that suit them. In any given city, the lobby is now the heartbeat of the public areas, filled with people working on their laptops,’’ Parker says. Fettle blends elements from midcentury, art deco, industrial and British design. “People want break-out lounge furniture and meeting tables, but when evening rolls around and the laptops are tucked away, the lobby transforms,’’ Parker says. The company’s design for the lobby of the Hoxton Hotel in Portland, Oregon, for example, has a communal work table and a comfortable lounge seating around a fireplace. The public areas were situated in an old, converted movie theater. Tailored but comfy mohair and leather seating and warm wood side tables blend with distressed rugs and displays of ceramics, plants and books. Refurbished timber and concrete beams frame the spaces. And there’s a story about the reception area’s wood paneling. “We used a lot of local suppliers and material for this project,” Parker says. “The area around Portland is a big producer of Maraschino cherries; the visible face of the wall is made from the outside of reclaimed cherry vats. If you look closely you can even see the imprints where the metal belts that hold the huge vats together were pressed against the wood.” In many hotels, Parker notes, ``It’s not just hotel guests who are using them, but the locals who come to work in these spaces.” Paul Makovsky, editor in chief for Contract, a magazine focused on commercial interior design and architecture, says this mix of workspace and hospitality is being called “corporatality.” Hotel chain CitizenM on Manhattan’s Lower East Side uses the tagline, “You may not be a New York native, but you can feel like one here.” Colorful lounge chairs face a soaring shelf wall filled with eclectic curios, art and books. In Scotland, Glasgow’s Motel One is next to the main railway station, which takes passengers into the Scottish Highlands. The hotel commissioned oversize images from photographers Louise Scullion and Matthew Dalziel, who rode the route shooting atmospheric, romantic pictures of scenery, shaggy cows and travelers. The chain’s interior designer Katharina Schmidt used the photos in both private and public spaces, adding wooly sheep stools, tartan-covered modern chairs, displays of vintage hatboxes and trains, and pendant lights evoking crystal-cut whiskey glasses. At Motel One’s property in Zurich, Switzerland, brown and tan leather furniture and padded wallcoverings suggest luscious Swiss chocolates, while the lake outdoors is evoked with brass boat propellers, porthole mirrors and wallpaper printed with puffy white clouds. In Manchester England, the area’s history as a yarn and textile marketplace informed Motel One’s design; Schmidt commissioned artist Andy Singleton to create sculptures inspired by spools of yarn and fabric. Ceiling lights by Arturo Alvarez resemble cotton bolls. At the 1 Hotel in West Hollywood, California, RCH Studios extended the interior space to an ``outdoor lobby.’’ Hiking trails next to the hotel were the inspiration; guests can explore a granite pathway that meanders through native greenery. Log seating and timber planters were made from salvaged, fallen trees. High-speed internet has become more important than a work desk in today’s hotel rooms, says Parker. With lighter, thinner tech, we can work in different positions. So, there’s more lounge furniture and fewer desks, along with charging capabilities in table and sofa bases. Some hotels are also responding to the self-care trend, says Makovsky. Equinox’s hotel rooms in New York, L.A. and Chicago feature dark, moody atmospheres with soothing acoustics, proprietary mattresses, and relaxation and sleep programs. Marriott’s Stay Well rooms have enhanced air and water filtration, natural-materials mattresses and vitamin C-infused showers. As in many lobbies, there’s homey decor touches in rooms, too. At the State Hotel in Seattle, artist Kate Blairstone’s wallpaper pays homage to the city’s produce, flowers and seafood, while in the rooms her custom portraits of local residents adorn the walls. In their Bowery property in New York City, CitizenM commissioned graffiti artists to provide custom works for the stairwells, creating the Museum of Street Art for guests and neighbors to enjoy.",Associated Press News,"If you look closely you can even see the imprints where the metal belts that hold the huge vats together were pressed against the wood.” In many hotels, Parker notes, ``It’s not just hotel guests who are using them, but the locals who come to work in these spaces.” Paul Makovsky, editor in chief for Contract, a magazine focused on commercial interior design and architecture, says this mix of workspace and hospitality is being called “corporatality.” Hotel chain CitizenM on Manhattan’s Lower East Side uses the tagline, “You may not be a New York native, but you can feel like one here.” Colorful lounge chairs face a soaring shelf wall filled with eclectic curios, art and books.

Many of these new songs reflect older Jimmy Eat World themes: ""Your sense of self-worth coming from external validation is an empty pursuit,"" Jim Adkins tells the crowd. So as guitarist Tom Linton joins the band, they launch into ""The Middle."" Over time, this feel-good Bleed American single has remained a constant source of goodness in a sometimes bleak world.

"Space Traffic Is Surging, And Critics Worry There Could Be A Crash",https://www.npr.org/2020/01/29/800433686/space-traffic-is-surging-and-critics-worry-there-could-be-a-crash,2020-01-29,"SpaceX has launched dozens of satellites as part of its Starlink project to bring high-speed Internet to every point on the planet. A rocket from the commercial company SpaceX lifted off on Wednesday morning with some 60 satellites aboard. Once they reached low Earth orbit, the satellites were released and began to fan out like a deck of cards. They follow predictable paths around the Earth, but along the way those paths can cross with other things in orbit — satellites from other companies, old rocket stages, loose bits of metal — and cause a catastrophic collision. Some satellite operations experts say that all too often, only one thing stands in the way of disaster: an automated email alert sent to the inboxes of operators on the ground. ""That is crazy,"" says Brian Weeden, director of program planning at the Secure World Foundation, which promotes sustainability in space. ""But that's currently the status of things."" Now Weeden and others feel it's time for a hard look at the system for managing space traffic, which they think is ad hoc and ill-prepared for what's to come. In just three launches since November, SpaceX has added nearly 200 satellites to a slice of the sky above Earth that's already pretty congested. It plans to launch hundreds more this year, as does a rival company, OneWeb. Both companies say they are diligently complying with voluntary standards to minimize space debris, but critics say those standards simply aren't adequate. ""We're already out in front of the headlights, so to speak,"" says Moriba Jah, an expert in orbital mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin. ""And I think a major cataclysm of some form will happen in space that will have very long-term consequences."" The closest thing the world has to a space traffic control is the U.S. military's 18th Space Control Squadron. ""Currently, we have a catalog of approximately 26,000 objects,"" says Diana McKissock, who helps oversee what the military calls ""space situational awareness."" (That's a fancy name for keeping tabs on everything up there that's bigger than about the size of a softball.) The military tracks all of it with a global network of radars and telescopes. It takes measurements and then feeds them into an old computer. ""It was first designed in 1983, but the version that we currently use was considered operational in 1996,"" McKissock says. The military uses radars to watch for ballistic missiles. It also tracks satellites. Each day, the computer system calculates thousands of potential collisions between objects and spits out the appropriate warnings. With SpaceX launching satellites by the dozens, the 18th Space Control Squadron has been put to the test. Each new satellite must be individually identified and tracked by the network long enough to establish its orbital path. SpaceX says it is committed to helping ensure safety in space. The company has been supplying the military with orbital data to speed the identification and tracking process. ""I won't say it's easy,"" McKissock says. ""But I will say when faced with a challenge, it's amazing what innovation can come out of meeting that challenge."" For critics of the current system, the real issues come after possible collisions are identified. Once a warning message is sent, McKissock says, the military has no further role in what happens next. ""There is nothing in place after we send those messages to ensure that people are making decisions that benefit the entire space community,"" she says. About six months ago, a SpaceX satellite and a European Space Agency satellite were predicted to have a close pass. SpaceX saw an initial email from the military and felt that the two satellites would probably speed by each other at a safe distance. The problem, says Weeden of the Secure World Foundation, was that there was a second email. I think a major cataclysm of some form will happen in space that will have very long-term consequences. ""There was a new email they got that had a much closer approach that somehow got trapped in a spam folder or just didn't make it to the right people,"" he says. ""That was a problem."" SpaceX says it has fixed that problem. But Weeden says the real issue runs deeper. There are no standards for how close is too close or what satellite operators should do if they get a notice of a possible collision: ""It's up to each and every operator to decide for themselves what they want to do, if anything, in response to those close-approach warnings."" Jah says there's an incentive not to move — because to get out of the way, satellites have to expend some of their precious fuel. ""Propellant is like platinum up there,"" he says. ""Whenever my propellant is gone, I'm done. I don't make money or I lose the service."" Operators must weigh the risks to their satellite against these very real costs, and they can arrive at different decisions. SpaceX's new Starlink system is supposed to entail thousands of satellites. The company says it's developing an automated collision-avoidance system so satellites can move themselves out of the way. Each Starlink launch contains a stack of 60 or so satellites. But that doesn't satisfy Jah. As many hundreds of new satellites go up this year, he says, the companies can't just make decisions in a vacuum. Often, a company will rely on its own highly accurate data for its satellites — but use lower-quality public data for other objects. Foreign governments also have their own data. All of this means that companies might not reach the same conclusions on the potential for a crash or how to move out of the way. ""Each of them thinks of themselves to be quite smart, and we have the right people to maybe automate maneuvers or figure these things out,"" he says. ""But that's done in the absence of the reasoning of the other people."" Jah believes what's needed is a global set of standards for what data to use and for how close is too close and regulations that clearly lay out the right of way. But, he says, such a system remains far off and there's no obvious international body that could take on the responsibility for such rules. In the U.S., the Commerce Department might take a larger role. The Trump administration has tasked that department with overseeing commercial uses of space, but it's just getting started. In the meantime, the job of coordinating space traffic remains spread across the military, which monitors for collisions, and the Federal Communications Commission and Federal Aviation Administration, which approve and oversee launches. Given the current system, Jah worries that a collision is only a matter of time. If it happens, ""people will move swiftly to try to do something,"" he says. ""But I think it's going to be reactionary, unfortunately.""",NPR,"As many hundreds of new satellites go up this year, he says, the companies can't just make decisions in a vacuum.

Florida's Brightline Railroad Is Nation's Deadliest After High Rate Of Track Deaths ,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/29/799962246/brightline-nations-deadliest-railroad-after-high-number-of-track-deaths,2020-01-29,"A Brightline train approaches a railroad crossing on Jan. 18, 2018, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. In its first two years, more than 40 people have been killed by Brightline trains on tracks and at rail crossings. Officials in Florida are considering legislation aimed at curbing the high number of deaths on the tracks of a new passenger rail line. Brightline is a privately owned rail service operating trains between Miami and West Palm Beach. In its first two years, more than 40 people have been killed by Brightline trains on tracks and at rail crossings, earning it a designation as the nation's deadliest railroad. Brightline's trains operate at speeds of up to 79 miles per hour over a 70-mile stretch of track in South Florida. It's not high-speed rail but is still much faster than the trains that people have been used to seeing on these tracks. The rail line has been here more than a century, part of the Florida East Coast Railway. In recent decades, until Brightline, the line was used just by slower freight trains. Since Brightline launched two years ago, on average more than one person a month has been killed on the tracks, in a car, on a bike or on foot. An analysis by The Associated Press found that this was the worst death rate per mile of any of the nation's railroads. Brightline has responded with a public education campaign, warning people to stay off the tracks. At a recent news conference, Ben Porritt of Brightline said, ""Too many people take unnecessary chances by driving around the gates, running across the tracks."" At the news conference next to the company's tracks in Oakland Park, Porritt focused on a group that he said makes up a majority of the fatalities. ""Seventy-five percent of the incidents that we've seen are the results of suicide or drugs,"" Porritt said. ""It's an industrywide concern. It just doesn't affect Brightline. It affects every railroad across the country."" Suicides on train tracks are a national problem, but nowhere near the 75% figure cited by Brightline. A U.S. Department of Transportation study shows that suicides account for about 30% of all rail fatalities. Accident reports on the Federal Railroad Administration's website attribute only a handful of Brightline fatalities to suicide. The company says it arrived at its higher number after conducting investigations that included analyzing videos of the accidents filmed from its train cabs. Many railroad crossings have features designed to discourage motorists and pedestrians from trying to beat the train —including sets of four gates, which block all the lanes. But those aren't always enough. But rail safety activists aren't convinced. ""We say its baloney that high a percentage of suicide,"" says Susan Mehiel, with Alliance for Safe Trains, a group that has advocated for closer government regulation of the privately owned rail line. ""We believe that trains and communities everywhere have problems with drugs and alcohol addiction and suicide. But not like this."" Mehiel believes the reason the rail line leads the nation in fatalities is because its trains run so fast through densely populated communities. ""There are not enough safety features, including pedestrian gates, pedestrian channeling, pedestrian bridges and fencing,"" she says. ""Fencing is a really big one."" Mehiel's group supports a bill in Florida's legislature that would allow the state's Department of Transportation to enforce safety standards for rail lines like Brightline. At a hearing in Tallahassee, Brightline's Rusty Roberts said the company has been working with local communities to identify problem areas where it has upgraded fencing and other barriers. But, he said, doing so is expensive. ""That fencing in our case is over $200,000 a mile,"" he says. ""So if you start regulating fencing in a blanket way, it's very costly for the railroads to do that."" Brightline is working on a $4 billion expansion that will take the rail line from West Palm Beach north along the coast and then west to Orlando. The sponsor of the rail safety bill in the Florida Senate, Debbie Mayfield, represents Indian River and Brevard counties, two of the coastal areas the train will run through. At the hearing, she said, ""40 deaths since they have started operating from West Palm to Miami. My goal is to not have deaths when it comes through Martin, St. Lucie, Indian River, Brevard and goes on up."" Brightline says too much regulation could threaten the nation's largest privately funded transportation project, one that's aiming to take cars off Florida's crowded roads.",NPR,"Brightline says too much regulation could threaten the nation's largest privately funded transportation project, one that's aiming to take cars off Florida's crowded roads.

1 Simple Step Could Help Election Security. Governments Aren't Doing It,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/29/800131854/1-simple-step-could-help-election-security-governments-arent-doing-it,2020-01-29,"Computer mouse pads with ""Secure the Vote"" logos on them sit on a vendor's table at an election officials conference in 2018. Local governments across the United States could perform a simple upgrade to strengthen voters' confidence that they are what they say they are: use websites that end in .gov. Federal officials control the keys to the "".gov"" top-level domain, making it less likely that somebody could get one fraudulently and use it to fool people. Domains that end in .com or .org, meanwhile, could be set up by attackers to try to intercept users seeking information from real sources. But with an uneven appreciation across the country about the way a fake website could deceive users, and with little guidance from officialdom about what to do, many counties aren't taking that step, cyberspecialists say. ""The big problem today is we don't have a simple rule to tell people how to differentiate a legitimate election domain from one that was set up for malicious purposes,"" says Steve Grobman, a senior vice president at the cybersecurity firm McAfee. A McAfee analysis found that 95% of counties in Texas and Minnesota, 91% of counties in Michigan and 90% of counties in New Hampshire aren't using .gov addresses. An NPR analysis of counties in Iowa, where voters are set to take part in the first-in-the-nation primary caucuses on Monday, found just nine of 99 counties using .gov addresses. That's a glaring issue that could open up the door for a simple but potentially disastrous disinformation attack, says Grobman. An attacker could mimic a real elections site by buying a similar domain name, copying the site and then picking a district in which to suppress votes. ""They could choose urban areas if they wish to suppress Democratic votes. They could choose rural areas if they choose to suppress Republican votes,"" Grobman says. ""They would then send an email to users in those different districts that point them to a fraudulent site."" A fake site could look identical to a real site, only with slightly wrong polling-location information or slightly wrong times. If both websites — the real one and the fake one — are closely alike and use .com top-level domains, voters probably would have no idea they were being manipulated until they showed up at a closed or empty polling location. ""Even narrowing the window slightly could suppress enough votes to make a material difference in the outcome of the election,"" Grobman says. When it comes to getting good information, the Internet is a minefield. That's a problem especially for governments, which need to get information out to people about things such as voting and have people be confident that what they're reading is legitimate. That's not a given in 2020. A plurality of Americans think misleading information is the biggest threat to a secure and accurate election this year, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll. ""One of the effective ways we think to counter disinformation campaigns is to have highly visible, credible and trustworthy sources of information,"" says Chris Krebs, the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency within the Department of Homeland Security. Cybersecurity experts as well as federal government officials say having the entire government system — from localities to states to the federal government — all using .gov addresses would make it simple for people to know immediately that the website they're reading is to be trusted. ""Dot-gov is an authoritative message,"" Krebs says. ""It says this is, in fact, government."" But thousands of local governments across the country aren't using it for websites that house their election information. That creates the possibility for attackers to exploit such domains by creating a fake site. While such a plot might sound complicated, Grobman says it would take less than an hour for a malicious actor to build such a trap website. Experts also say not having a consistent domain name structure for local governments makes it harder for them to communicate with each other. Leading up to the 2016 election, attackers used email addresses that mimicked real addresses within the elections world to try to entice local officials to click on links. Dot-gov addresses are harder to spoof than dot-coms or dot-orgs, so phishing attacks like this would be harder to pull off if official websites were uniform. The biggest reason more counties don't use the .gov infrastructure is a lack of communication from the federal government, officials, including Krebs, told NPR. Basically, many local election leaders don't know it matters. Last year, for example, Clinton County, Iowa, got a brand-new elections website. It has a clean layout with easy-to-use buttons labeled ""Register to Vote,"" ""Am I Registered?"" and ""How Do I Vote?"" ""We love it,"" says Eric Van Lancker, the commissioner of elections for Clinton County. ""We've been looking for something like this for years."" The URL, however, is clintoncountyelections.com — a dot-com URL. The home page for the elections website in Clinton County, Iowa. Although the website is sleekly designed, it is housed on a .com, and not on the recommended .gov, top-level domain. Getting a .gov address isn't a particularly difficult process: It costs around $400 a year and usually takes a few weeks for the paperwork to process. But Van Lancker says he just wasn't aware that it was recommended by the federal government. ""I think I'm pretty on top of the election issues and such here in the state of Iowa,"" Van Lancker says. ""But I never heard anything about that."" That's not surprising, says Andrea Limbago, the chief social scientist at the cybersecurity company Virtru. She says that local officials have many disparate roles, and thinking about how their websites fit into the broader information landscape of America isn't usually at the top of the list. ""To assume that county officials have the full knowledge to be cybersecurity experts, I think it's unfair to expect that of them,"" Limbago says. ""We don't really provide them a lot of the tools that are necessary."" A bill currently in committee in Congress would make .gov domain names available to local governments at ""no cost or negligible cost."" If passed, it would also move responsibility for the domain program and the outreach about that domain program from the General Services Administration to Krebs' agency in DHS. ""There's an awareness gap,"" Krebs says. ""We need to do a better job of going out there and helping state and local partners know that this is something available to them.""",NPR,"Federal officials control the keys to the "".gov"" top-level domain, making it less likely that somebody could get one fraudulently and use it to fool people.

"Impeachment Trial Moves To Question Phase, While Witness Vote Looms",https://www.npr.org/2020/01/29/799371386/impeachment-trial-moves-to-question-phase-while-witness-vote-looms,2020-01-29,"House Democratic impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff (second from left) leaves a news conference on Capitol Hill on Tuesday. President Trump's impeachment trial moves Wednesday to its next phase: written questions from senators. For up to 16 hours spread over two days, senators from both parties will submit questions to House managers prosecuting the case as well as Trump's defense lawyers; U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, will read the questions aloud on the floor of the chamber. Watch the proceedings live when the begin at 1 p.m. ET. This step in the proceedings comes a day after the president's legal team rested in its defense of Trump. Democratic House managers made their case last week on why the president should be removed from office. Trump was impeached last month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. During the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, senators asked more than 150 questions over two days. Republicans and Democrats reached a deal in which the parties will take turns asking questions for up to eight hours Wednesday. The same rules and duration for questions has been allotted for Thursday. That sets the stage for a Friday vote on whether to allow witnesses. According to Democrats, multiple potential witnesses have firsthand accounts of what they say is a quid pro quo scheme with Ukraine that forms the basis of the two impeachment charges Trump is facing. Democrats say witnesses are essential for a fair trial, while Republicans maintain that witnesses can inject uncertainty into the proceedings and prolong the trial. Among the sought-after witnesses is former national security adviser John Bolton, who captured Washington's attention this week following the release of revelations in his forthcoming book that Trump allegedly told him that military assistance was only to be released after Ukraine opened investigations into Trump's Democratic rivals. Those purported book details, first reported by The New York Times, placed pressure on senators to vote to allow witnesses into the trial. Loading... Trump's defense team, in response, argued that a manuscript of Bolton's book would be ""inadmissible"" in the trial. Defense lawyer Jay Sekulow said impeachment ""is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts."" Anything Bolton would have to offer in person about his conversations with the president, argued Trump attorney Alan Dershowitz, would not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. Whether Republicans can defeat the Democrats' push for witnesses, including Bolton, is unclear. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told Republicans in a closed-door meeting late Tuesday that the party does not yet have the votes to block new witnesses, but that does not mean Democrats will be able to subpoena Bolton or any other witness. That decision will likely come down to moderate Republicans including Mitt Romney, R-Utah; Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; and Susan Collins, R-Maine; who have indicated they may be open to hearing from witnesses, but their final decision is still unknown. Trump's defense team argued earlier this week that the case against the president presented by Democrats does not constitute any impeachable offenses. Lawyers for Trump have accused Democrats of trying to invalidate the result of the 2016 election. They say Trump has not committed any crime and therefore cannot be removed from office, even though many legal scholars say a law need not be broken in order to secure an impeachment conviction that would remove a president from office. Although two previous presidents, Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have also been impeached, no U.S. president has ever been removed from office. Democrats impeached Trump last month for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for what the prosecution team says was a campaign to pressure Ukraine into opening investigations into Trump's political rivals and held-up $391 million in congressionally approved security assistance in order to apply leverage on Ukrainian authorities. House Democrats say the White House's refusal to cooperate with the impeachment investigation is proof of a cover-up and amounts to obstruction.",NPR,"Those purported book details, first reported by The New York Times, placed pressure on senators to vote to allow witnesses into the trial.

England's Test jigsaw - are the pieces falling into place? - BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/51281678,2020-01-29,"Putting together a Test team that wins consistently in all conditions can be a brain-teasing puzzle. Sometimes you haven't got the right pieces. What was once the right piece can change shape and no longer fit. Forcing a square into a circular hole seldom works. For England, the jigsaw is a long way from being complete but, either by accident or design, they leave South Africa with a fuller picture than when they arrived. Over the next two winters, England face trips to India, then Australia, perhaps the two most demanding tours in Test cricket. The last time England had a settled top order, Boris Johnson was mayor of London and Joe Root had yet to make his Test debut. You could argue that it still isn't settled. However, the problem now isn't who to pick, but who to leave out. Dom Sibley has taken his chance by being England's highest run-scorer in South Africa, while an injury to senior opener Rory Burns gave an opportunity to Zak Crawley. Even if Crawley didn't return a big score, he showed enough potential to suggest he is worth persevering with. He can be loose at times, but is only 21. And he certainly has the shots to hurt Test attacks. Burns won't be fit for the March tour of Sri Lanka, so England have time to settle on their first-choice openers. When they do, it might be that Crawley slips to number three in place of Kent colleague Joe Denly. Denly has done little wrong in his 14 Tests and his steady presence in the top order has given freedom to the strokeplayers lower down. However, he is 33 years old and his ceiling is surely lower than Crawley's. Selection for Sri Lanka may throw another name into the mix, with talk of a recall for Keaton Jennings, whose two Test centuries have come on the sub-continent. Despite always tailoring their bowlers to conditions, Test sides rarely do it with batsmen. It is an interesting idea, but a big call to split the blossoming Sibley-Crawley partnership. England leave South Africa with their numbers four, five and six looking certain, dependable and powerful. At the moment, this area might be the team's biggest strength. For so long, skipper Root, Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow, Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali have been shuffled around in an attempt to mask deficiencies elsewhere. It didn't work and, in some cases, inflicted lasting damage on the yo-yoing batsmen. Because England have not been finding themselves 20-2 and 30-3, Root, Stokes and Ollie Pope are not being required to pick through rubble, but instead build on firmer foundations. There were questions over how much the captaincy was affecting Root's batting during the tour of New Zealand before Christmas, questions he answered with a double century in the second Test. His average of 55.60 this winter is his best period with the bat as skipper since 2017, his first summer in charge. As for Stokes, the superlatives are fast being exhausted. A constant source of inspiration with the ball and in the field, it is with the bat where his game has really gone to the next level. Only Australia's Marnus Labuschagne and Root have more Test runs than Stokes since the beginning of last year - and Stokes is averaging almost 10 runs more per innings than his captain. In Pope, England have unearthed their most exciting batting talent since the emergence of Root. He should be allowed to develop at number six, with his inevitable move up the order delayed until after the next Ashes tour. Little more than a year ago, England had so many wicketkeepers worth their place in the side that all of Bairstow, Buttler and Ben Foakes were crammed in. Now, none of them can make an irrefutable case for selection. Bairstow's poor form resulted in him being stripped of the gloves at the end of the home summer. He was recalled for South Africa despite playing no first-class cricket in between, then made only one and nine in the first Test. His career is at a crossroads. After being recalled in 2018, Buttler averaged 45 across the year, only for that to drop to 25 in 2019 and 16 in 2020. If England's top six are firing, then the destruction Buttler can bring at number seven is a huge asset. However, he has only one century in 41 Tests. How long can they wait for him to deliver on a consistent basis? Foakes is the best gloveman of the three, scored a century on debut in Sri Lanka at the end of 2018 and did little to merit being dropped in the West Indies a few months later. What followed was a difficult season with Surrey, when he struggled for runs. England may opt to stick with Buttler in Sri Lanka or decide that so much standing up to the stumps for the spin bowlers necessitates the superior keeping skills of Foakes. If whoever gets the gig does not make the position their own, the early part of the 2020 domestic season may present a rare opportunity for a keeper to emerge from county cricket. Keep your eye on Kent's Ollie Robinson. Tyson Fury calls himself the lineal heavyweight champion because he has never been beaten. His belts were removed from him, rather than surrendered in the ring. Like Fury laying claim to his throne, so too can three men say they are England's number one spinner. Dom Bess is the incumbent, having impressed in his two Tests in South Africa, but he only got the chance because of illness to Somerset team-mate Jack Leach, who has never let England down. Moeen was dropped after a poor first Ashes Test in August and has since opted to make himself unavailable for the longest form of the game. At his best, he is the one England would plump for over all others. They would dearly love Moeen to make himself available for Sri Lanka and the daunting five-Test tour of India next winter, two trips where he could find himself in the same XI as Bess and Leach. In all this, the right character to take on Australia down under must be identified. On England's past two Ashes tours, Graeme Swann and Moeen were hit out of the series, resulting in one-cap appearances for Scott Borthwick in 2014 and Mason Crane in 2018. If the pattern is repeated in 2022, England will have almost certainly suffered another defeat. For so long, England have feared the day when James Anderson finally stops swinging. Lately, they have been given a window into their future. Because of injuries, Anderson has played only three of England's past 12 Tests, and in one of those he bowled just four overs. In that time, England's long desire for extreme pace has been fulfilled by the emergence of Jofra Archer and return of Mark Wood. Over the same period, Stuart Broad has looked rejuvenated, while Sam Curran and Chris Woakes have provided the back-up. Almost two years away from their Ashes mission, England look to be assembling the weapons that may finally allow them to go toe-to-toe with Australia. The challenge will be to keep everyone fit. On top of Anderson's recent struggles, Wood's career has involved more time in rehab than on the field and Archer's elbow gave way to the workload undertaken in his first year as an international cricketer. Olly Stone played one Test and has not been seen since because of a back injury. It will be fascinating to see who England regard as their frontline pace bowlers when - or, as is more likely, if - all of them are fit at once. Because pace will not play as big a role in Sri Lanka and India, those tours should allow the various aging and fragile bodies to be rested and rotated, all with the aim of arriving in Australia at full strength. What a mouth-watering prospect that would be.

Neelam Krishnamoorthy: The film tickets that destroyed a family - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50182595,2020-01-29,"Neelam Krishnamoorthy's children loved watching films - but one afternoon a routine cinema trip ended in a moment of tragedy, and left Neelam fighting a decades-long battle for justice. On the morning of 13 June 1997, Neelam Krishnamoorthy rang a popular cinema in Delhi - Uphaar - and bought two tickets for Border, a star-studded Bollywood film about the 1971 war between India and Pakistan. It had hit the screens that day. It was the summer holidays and her children, Unnati, 17, and Ujjwal, 13, wanted to watch it. ""She [Unnati] was a big movie buff,"" says Neelam. ""She wanted to see this movie first day. So I promised her I'd book the tickets for her."" The whole family ate lunch together - Neelam remembers the chicken curry her husband, Shekhar, had cooked. And she remembers the kiss Unnati planted on her cheek before she and Ujjwal left for the film. It was the last time she saw her children alive. At 4.55pm, a fire broke out in the cinema's parking lot. The smoke spread up the stairs and entered the cinema hall. Witnesses said people poured out of the ground floor of the building, while some of those on higher floors smashed windows and jumped out to escape. But many were trapped inside as emergency vehicles laboured through evening traffic to reach the spot in the south Delhi neighbourhood of Green Park. It was several hours before the Krishnamoorthys knew what had happened to their children. Neelam doesn't remember what time it was when she walked into a room full of stretchers in AIIMS hospital, and recognised Unnati's body. Ujjwal was on another stretcher, a few feet away. ""That's the day our world came to our end,"" she says. ""Everything… just finished."" Fifty-nine people died, among them 23 children, the youngest one month old. More than a hundred were injured. It remains one of India's most tragic fires. Soon, Neelam would learn that her children's deaths had been far from inevitable. And that discovery would drive her into a long, gruelling fight against powerful property developers, sluggish courts and, at times, her own unspeakable grief. The Krishnamoorthys' living room has birthday cards and photographs of Unnati and Ujjwal over the years - in one of them, she has her arm around him and they are both grinning. Neelam picks up a thick photo album from the coffee table and starts turning the pages. ""This is on Ujjwal's 11th birthday..."" she says wistfully, pointing at a photo of him cutting a cake. Neelam is also in the photograph - she's in bed with a fractured leg. Ujjwal insisted on cutting the cake in her bedroom, even though he had friends over. Neelam says they were a close-knit, fun-loving family. They enjoyed eating out, they travelled a lot and they celebrated every birthday and anniversary. She describes her children as kind, outgoing and friendly. In the summer of 1997, Unnati had finished school and was excited about college. Ujjwal was in the school choir, which he loved. The Krishnamoorthys have moved into a new home since then but Neelam has recreated the children's room like it was on that day. She doesn't allow outsiders into the room but she says she has kept every little thing that belonged to them - Ujjwal's cap is still on the bed where he left it. She says she still goes into their room every morning and every night. ""The time when I am very upset I go and sit in their room and I spend a lot of time there."" She has also held on to the most tangible reminder of that day: two pink, flimsy movie tickets. She gingerly pulls them out of a black, leather wallet. It was a gift from her to Ujjwal. The tickets are torn at the edges but you can see the timing of the show - Friday, 3.15pm - and the name of the cinema is printed across the middle. ""I call them tickets to death. As a mother I feel very guilty because I booked the tickets."" She also has Unnati's purse, which she was carrying that day. The tickets, the wallet, the purse - they were all undamaged because Unnati and Ujjwal did not suffer any burns. It was only days later that Neelam began to wonder what happened at Uphaar. Unnati, Ujjwal and all the other victims had been sitting in the balcony above the main hall. ""It was when I read the papers, I realised that the fire had started a long time back, the movie kept running, they were not informed, the doors were closed, the gatekeeper had run away. I mean, I realised they didn't have to die."" An inquiry into the fire found that this had indeed been the case. The owners had added 52 extra seats in the balcony over the years, blocking a crucial exit and narrowing paths to the other exits. There were also no emergency lights or footlights. Survivors from the balcony told the court that they stumbled towards the exits in pitch darkness. Some managed to pry open a locked door and squeeze through only to faint in the smoke-filled lobby. But those inside choked to death on carbon monoxide fumes. This is the crux of Neelam's 22-year-long fight: the deaths were a man-made disaster, the result of broken rules and lax enforcement. The inquiry also found that the transformer in the basement that had caused the fire had not been installed correctly, increasing the risk of fire. It had caused another fire earlier that day, which had been quickly put out, but shoddy repairs resulted in the second and fatal fire. The more Neelam learnt, the angrier she got. And the more convinced she became that she had to fight for her children. ""I told Shekhar I want to get the people responsible for this tragedy. I want to send them behind bars."" India has a dismal record in public safety and tragedies like these are alarmingly common. But what is rare is for victims' families to hold someone accountable. So Neelam and Shekhar's decision to do that unnerved family and friends. Some suggested that they have another child to move on - but this was never an option for the couple. ""You do everything for your children [while] they are alive,"" says Neelam. ""So why would I stop doing something for them when they are no more?"" The state accused 16 men of causing the deaths in Uphaar - they included staff at the cinema, and safety inspectors who overlooked glaring violations throughout the building. The most high-profile accused were Sushil and Gopal Ansal, two brothers who owned the cinema. Neelam and Shekhar formed an association with families of the other victims to support the prosecution. And Neelam started to educate herself about everything, from safety rules for cinema halls to criminal law. But nothing prepared her for India's overburdened and understaffed courts. It was a decade later - in 2007 - that the court finally found all 16 men guilty, by which time four of them had died. The sentences ranged from seven months to seven years - some were found guilty of negligence, while others were found guilty of more serious charges. The Ansal brothers were given two years in jail, the maximum sentence for their charge. ""It came as a shock to me that they gave just a two-year sentence for someone responsible for killing 59 lives,"" says Neelam. She had been fighting for them to be charged with a graver offence, on the grounds that decisions they took, as the cinema's owners, had proved fatal. But when she challenged the sentence in the Delhi high court, rather than being increased, it was halved. ""The reason given was that they are educated, they have a good social status,"" says Neelam. ""I found those reasons pretty pathetic. Because if you are educated, you should have been more prudent and followed all the rules."" So she appealed to the Supreme Court, which delivered its ruling in 2015. And this time the Ansal brothers' custodial sentences were waived altogether. Instead, each was fined $4m. ""I just threw all the documents I had in the court,"" she says, recalling that day. ""I walked out of the court and I burst into tears. That was the first time I cried publicly."" She says that day, she and Shekhar couldn't visit the children's room - they spent the whole night in the drawing room, wondering what they could have done differently. It was a ruling, she says, that shook her faith in the judiciary. But she eventually went back to the Supreme Court for another appeal. This time, the court ordered Gopal Ansal to serve one year in jail. Sushil Ansal, then 77, was released on account of old age. That was in 2017. Neelam has one more challenge pending. She has petitioned the Supreme Court again, asking for the Ansals to serve the full two years of their original sentence, since neither of them has completed two years in jail. She doesn't know when the court will begin its hearings. Over the years, she has committed the case to memory - every order, appeal, verdict and document that is spilling out of the boxes and shelves in her home office. ""I have read every single document,"" she says. ""There are almost 50,000 pages to be read in the main case alone."" She says she has lost count of how many hearings Shekhar and she have attended -  they still spend hours in courtrooms every other day. And she takes copious notes so she is always in the loop, and can question or prod the prosecutor if necessary. What keeps them going, Neelam says, is the promise they made to their children to get justice for them - although at times, she feels like she has failed them and despair takes over. ""If I had to do it all over again, I would just pick up a gun and shoot the guys who were responsible for my children's death. I would not like to go through this trauma. After killing them, I can kill myself so I don't suffer. As simple as that."" Uphaar cinema is still standing - grimy and dilapidated, it bears the marks of the tragedy 22 years ago. It can't be torn down until judges have ruled on Neelam's final challenge. ""I try not to even look at this building when I come here,"" says Neelam, standing with her back to it. ""I had my bank right here. I didn't visit it for almost 12 years."" Across from Uphaar is a small park with a round black granite fountain - a memorial to the victims of the fire. It has their names with their date of birth. Neelam visits the park three times a year - on her children's birthdays and on the anniversary of the fire. She goes straight to the memorial, touches the spot where Unnati's and Ujjwal's names are inscribed, folds her hands and closes her eyes. ""I just pray because I think... this is where they died and I very strongly feel that they are still not at peace."" Imagine your life being changed by a single dramatic moment. This is what happened to a top scientist in the Indian space programme, when one day, 25 years ago, police officers knocked at his door.",BBC,"She says that day, she and Shekhar couldn't visit the children's room - they spent the whole night in the drawing room, wondering what they could have done differently. ""It came as a shock to me that they gave just a two-year sentence for someone responsible for killing 59 lives,"" says Neelam.

Six Nations: The young stars to watch out for at the 2020 tournament - BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/rugby-union/51121348,2020-01-29,"And so it begins again. Three months on from England's final defeat by South Africa in Yokohama, rugby's World Cup cycle starts another spin. Back in 2016, with England recovering from a far less impressive World Cup campaign, Maro Itoje came into the Six Nations as a 21-year-old uncapped wannabe. Huw Jones, then 22, was still playing rugby in South Africa, off Scotland's radar. Ross Moriarty, 21, was included in coach Warren Gatland's Wales squad with just one Test start on his CV. With new coaches in position and new goals on the horizon, who are are the bright young things in the class of 2020 looking to seize their chance and take this year's tournament by the scruff of the neck. Rees lightning. King Louis. As good as Zammit. It is fortunate that his name lends itself to headlines because Gloucester's try-scoring sensation looks set to be a star for years to come. Back in April, the 18-year-old was producing coast-to-coast wonder scores for his club's second-string, but nobody expected him to make the step up so soon or so assuredly. However, five tries in December earned him the Premiership player of the month award and a swiftly put together senior deal from the Cherry and Whites. ""My dream is to represent Wales at an international level,"" admitted the Penarth-born teenager as he put pen to paper. Wayne Pivac was clearly listening, calling him up to Wales' Six Nations squad two days later. Standing six foot three inches tall, he combines dragster acceleration with intelligent running lines to poke holes in defences. He doesn't mind the donkey work either, showing appetite for defence and breakdown shifts. Former England wing and Rugby Union Weekly co-host Ugo Monye: ""Everything that he does is class. At 18, it is really obvious to focus on the physical attributes and he has real stand-out pace. ""But he also seems to have a really good rugby brain, the way that he gets involved in the game is impressive. He comes off his wing, looks really hungry, makes good reads and looks good in the air."" A couple of weeks out from the Six Nations, the England back row looked locked down; the 'Kamikaze Kid' axis of Sam Underhill and Tom Curry on either flank with Billy Vunipola, perhaps short of his best form but a key man for Eddie Jones, at eight. That changed when Vunipola suffered another broken arm playing for Saracens. Without a stand-out specialist number eight replacement in Eddie Jones' squad, it could be Earl who steps into the breach. A former England under-20 captain, he lacks the sheer ball-carrying heft of Vunipola but has a prodigious defensive work-rate, breakdown street smarts and the athleticism and nous to make metres out wide. He completed a literature degree last summer comparing epic poetry from Ancient Greece and the modern Caribbean. Saracens head coach Mark McCall: ""He's always going to have moments where he takes your breath away. He's so explosive and athletically-blessed, he is always going to do things that are eye-catching and will wow the crowd."" Nowhere was coach Fabian Galthie's determination to blood his young stars more obvious than in the number 10 position. Listed as his three possible fly-halves for the Six Nations were Romain Ntamack (age 20, 12 caps), Matthieu Jalibert (age 21, one cap) and Louis Carbonel (age 20, zero caps). While he is awaiting his first taste of international action, Carbonel has packed a lot into his career already. Trusted with the keys to Toulon's high-end machine, he has guided the star-studded squad to third in the French Top 14. At age-grade level, he has won back-to-back World Under-20 Championships with France, preferred at fly-half to Ntamack when he lifted his first in 2018. He is shrewd kicking out of hand, relentlessly accurate off the tee and a deceptively dangerous runner, packing pace and power into his nuggetty frame. French sports paper Midi Olympique: ""A reliable points scorer, strong defender and perfect game manager, the Toulon man has all the hallmarks of a great future, following in the footsteps of his father, Alain, double French champion with Toulon in 1987 and 1992."" Minozzi has already had one stand-out Six Nations. Back in 2018, the-then 21-year-old scored tries against Ireland, France, Wales and Scotland to earn a place in the team of the tournament and on the shortlist for the player of the tournament. Now, he needs another. He spent a year on the sidelines after injuring the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee in August 2018. For a player with an ankle-icer of a side-step and blurring fast-twitch top speed, it could have been a set-back that his career never fully recovered from. Fortunately it seems he is firing on all cylinders. He has scored five tries in six matches since making his comeback for Italy and has been slicing and dicing defences for new club Wasps. Wasps director of rugby and former Wales prop Dai Young: ""He has got some great attacking flair, fantastic footwork, plenty of pace, a good kicking game, the versatility to play wing or full-back. Being so young he is only going to get better. With Finn Russell ruled out of Scotland's Six Nations opener against Ireland after a breach of team discipline, Hastings is likely to be the man to step in at 10. It is a job he has already done at club level. Since Russell headed to France, Hastings has put together a string of fine performances for Warriors, combining his instinctive play-making and free running with measured game management and precise place-kicking. Hastings, the son of legendary Scotland full-back Gavin, has made just seven international starts, the latest of which featured a 26-point haul in the Rugby World Cup win over Russia. His passing arm was strengthened by a schoolboy athletics career in which he represented Scottish Schools in the javelin. Scotland coach Gregor Townsend: ""Adam has been outstanding over the last few weeks. ""I thought his game against Exeter was up there with the best performances I have seen from a stand-off over the last year or two. He will be more than ready to start for Scotland."" With Leinster team-mate Jack Conan out with a fractured foot and critics questioning CJ Stander's dynamism, Caelan Doris' time has come. The sound and fury of the Aviva Stadium for Ireland's opener against Scotland on Saturday is a long way from the tiny coastal village of Lacken, population about 500, where Doris grew up. The number eight recalls being in a class of just two at the local school. Doris moved on to Blackrock College - the alma mater of Brian O'Driscoll and others - and his career hit hyperdrive, representing Irish Schools and captaining Ireland Under-20s. A footballing number eight with deft hands and a strong shoulder in defence, he has three tries in 10 starts for Leinster this season. There is another weapon in his arsenal as well. His father Chris is a conceptual artist and psychotherapist who has passed down a mindfulness habit to his son to help him control and understand his emotions. Ireland coach Andy Farrell: ""The key point for any young player at international level is 'can they be themselves?' Can they take the field and play their game and not just hope it goes OK? Caelan is not fazed by anything. He doesn't accept coming second best."" Steve Hansen, Eddie Jones, John Barclay, Nicky Little and Xavier Rush recall their experiences with new Wales coach Wayne Pivac - and analyse his challenges ahead.

Australian Open: Alexander Zverev beats Stan Wawrinka to reach semis - BBC Sport,https://www.bbc.com/sport/tennis/51291122,2020-01-29,"Alexander Zverev is through to a Grand Slam semi-final for the first time after defeating Stan Wawrinka in four sets at the Australian Open. The German seventh seed beat the Swiss three-time Grand Slam champion 1-6 6-3 6-4 6-2, dropping a set for the first time in Melbourne this year. He lost the first five games in only 16 minutes but bounced back to convert five out of 13 break points. The 22-year-old will face Rafael Nadal or Dominic Thiem in the last four. World number one Nadal takes on Austrian fifth seed Thiem on the Rod Laver Arena at 08:30 GMT on Wednesday. In the other semi-final, 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer will face last year's Australian Open winner Novak Djokovic on Thursday. Wawrinka, who won the Australian Open in 2014, has now been knocked out at the quarter-final stage in three of the past four Grand Slams. The 34-year-old started strongly against Zverev, racing through the opening set and winning 16 out of 19 points on his serve, even though his first-serve percentage was only 32%. But Zverev really stepped up in the second, not dropping a point in five service games and breaking once to level at one set all. Both players lost their opening service games at the start of the third, before Zverev moved 4-2 up and then served out the set. The German opened up a 4-0 lead in the fourth as Wawrinka sprayed shots all over the court, possibly feeling the effects of two five-set matches earlier in the tournament against Andreas Seppi and Daniil Medvedev. Zverev, who had not gone beyond the fourth round in Melbourne prior to this year, said: ""I don't know what to say. I've done well in other tournaments, I've won Masters, I've won the ATP Finals, but I never could break that barrier in a Grand Slam. I'm happy to be in the semi-finals."" Addressing the crowd, he added: ""You guys cannot imagine what this means to me and I hope it will be the first of many."" Before the tournament, Zverev pledged to donate the full winner's prize fund to the Australian bushfire relief appeal if he claimed the title. When asked whether he intended to keep his promise following victory over Wawrinka, he said: ""I hope I can make it happen. I made the people of Australia a promise. I will keep that promise. ""I'm not a money-driven person. My parents always taught me with money you should achieve things that help others and help the people that need the money. For me right now, four million Australian dollars would be nice, very nice - I could buy myself a few cars of something. ""But there are people who actually need it for their homes, for rebuilding wildlife, houses and the life they once knew, so it's much more important that they get that money.""

Coronavirus: French Asians hit back at racism with 'I'm not a virus' - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51294305,2020-01-29,"French Asians have taken to social media to complain of a backlash against them in response to the Chinese coronavirus outbreak. China has already seen almost 6,000 cases and 132 deaths, and France has had four cases confirmed. Anti-Asian racism has been reported in the UK and elsewhere, and now French Asians have complained of abuse on public transport and social media. They have been using the hashtag JeNeSuisPasUnVirus (I'm not a virus). There was an outcry when local newspaper Le Courier Picard used the inflammatory headlines ""Alerte jaune"" (Yellow alert) and ""Le péril jaune?"" (Yellow peril?), complete with an image of a Chinese woman wearing a protective mask. Cette leçon de racisme décomplexé vous est offerte par le @CourrierPicard #coronavirus pic.twitter.com/jhcoNmsmm5 The paper quickly apologised, saying it had not meant to use some of the ""worst Asian stereotypes"". Stéphane Nivet, head of Licra (the International League against racism and anti-Semitism), said no newspaper would have dared use the headline ""Black alert"" so it was clear there was a problem. As the hashtag spread, one woman, Cathy Tran, described hearing two men on her way to work in the eastern town of Colmar saying; ""Watch out, a Chinese girl is coming our way."" ""On my way home from work, a man on a scooter passed me by, telling me to put on a mask,"" Ms Tran told the BBC. Another hashtag user complained: ""Stop asking if we're dangerous if we cough while all the people around us are doing so."" France is planning to send a plane to Wuhan on Thursday to evacuate about 250 people, including non-French EU citizens.

Shana Cheng, a 17-year-old Parisian of Vietnamese and Cambodian origin, told the BBC that she had faced humiliating comments on a bus in the city on Sunday from both young and old. ""There's a Chinese woman, she is going to contaminate us, she needs to go home,"" she heard one passenger say. People looked at her ""in a disgusted way, as if I was the virus"". No-one stood up for her, she said, so she decided to ignore the comments and listen to her music. But she did cough and sniff ""so as to play on their fears"", she added. Cathy Tran said she was not surprised by people's reactions and saw the coronavirus as an excuse for people to be racist. The difference this time was the degree of racism, which she had never experienced before. ""We rarely hear Asians speak about racism, because we are known to suffer in silence, but here we are all in the same basket and it's too much,"" she said.

Sex Education: 'I wish I knew sex could be fun growing up' - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/newsbeat-51094159,2020-01-29,"You might remember a condom on a banana, or just a general sense that if you have sex, you'll either get A) pregnant or B) a disease. We're talking about sex education at school. The messy corners of growing-up were tiptoed around by teachers who couldn't even bring themselves to say ""penis"". So when the TV show Sex Education - which centres around two students who set up a sex clinic in their school - first debuted on Netflix last year, it was a breath of fresh air. The first series boldly tackled topics including slut-shaming, abortion, virginity and masturbation - which Aimee Lou Wood, who plays Aimee Gibbs, told Radio 1 Newsbeat she ""thought was only a boy thing"". Growing up, Aimee thought she was a ""weirdo"" for wanting to masturbate. And when filming the series the 24-year-old found that other people felt the same. ""When I filmed a masturbation scene, extras were asking me, 'What do you mean you had a scene like that? That's only for boys'."" Chatting to some of the show's cast at the season two premiere it became obvious that lots of them feel they didn't learn enough about the realities of sex growing up. ""Food, jobs, sex... it's a very key part of life and we don't know enough about it,"" Aimee said. ""I wish I knew it was normal to want sex for pleasure, and not just to make babies."" The character Aimee plays has one of the most talked about storylines of the series. She is sexually assaulted and the series sees her coming to terms with what happened. Think that the reason people relate to this so much is because so many of us have had incidents like Aimee & no one helped. People made us feel dramatic. How amazing would it have been if we’d had people there to help face our fear. This series of #sexeducation was ELITE The storyline received huge reaction online. Sex Education really be showing how trauma doesn't sink in quickly but when it does, it will make you fear things that you could do or places you go to before (e.g Aimee refusing to take the bus) Aimee says her storyline had a ""huge impact"" on her. ""I had to go back to when I was that age and how trusting I was. A lot of girls will relate to it."" Emma Mackey, who plays the show's female lead Maeve, agrees that the programme is important in challenging taboos. ""The show makes you feel less lonely; I wish it existed when I was at school to make me feel more normal,"" she told us. When asked what they'd learnt during filming, the word ""vaginismus"" was quick to leave almost all cast members' mouths. The NHS says: ""Vaginismus is when the vagina suddenly tightens up just as you try to insert something into it."" Tanya Reynolds, whose character Lily has vaginismus, said: ""I didn't even know it had a name. So many women will watch this and realised there's not something wrong with them."" As of spring 2020, it will be compulsory for all primary schools in England to teach ""relationships education"", which looks at friendship and emotions. Sex education in primary schools is not compulsory. English secondary schools must teach relationship and sex education (RSE) lessons. Parents can specifically request for their children not to be involved in sex education lessons, but not relationship lessons. The government's new requirements for secondary sex education include STIs, pregnancy, contraception and miscarriages. Scotland announced plans to review RSE lessons last year, to include things like sexual harassment and consent. Wales will be introducing a new compulsory RSE curriculum in 2022. Northern Irish schools must teach RSE lessons, but individual schools can decide the content. The programme has been commended for showing sex in a more realistic way than most. It replaces your average lowly-lit romantic sex scenes with clumsy, awkward ones where the teenage characters mostly have no idea what they're doing. This meant the cast had to be comfortable during the filming process. Patricia Allison, who plays Otis's new girlfriend Ola, said: ""There was a sex director on set. They sent us a list before we had even read the script to ask how we felt about certain things. ""Even if you said you were OK with something, you can change your mind and say I'm not comfortable with it today. And that's OK."" She says filming the series taught her the ""importance of saying no"". The first season of Sex Education was one of two programmes that Netflix released viewing figures for. It was reportedly watched by more than 40 million households in its initial weeks. (That's people who watched 70% or more of an episode). The series has been highly praised for its diversity and representation in its casting and plot, which Emma says ""shouldn't be a big deal"". ""We're setting the bar high in that regard, but it's about time. It should be normal."" Otis' sexually-liberated best friend, Eric, struggles with homophobia and the relationship between sexuality and religion. Ncuti Gatwa, who plays Eric, said: ""I love that this gay, black kid is not apologising for being who he is."" The teaching of ""LGBT content"" in schools hasn't always been accepted. Last year there were ongoing protests outside a primary school in Birmingham which taught pupils about same-sex relationships as part of a teaching scheme called No Outsiders.

Coronavirus: Australia plans island quarantine as foreigners leave Wuhan - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-51290312,2020-01-29,"Hundreds of foreign nationals are being evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of China's coronavirus outbreak, as more deaths and cases are confirmed. Australia plans to quarantine its evacuees on Christmas island 2,000km (1,200 miles) from the mainland. Japan, the US and the EU are also repatriating their citizens. British Airways has suspended all flights to and from mainland China, as the UK's Foreign Office warned against ""all but essential travel"" there. Several other airlines have taken similar measures. United Airlines and Cathay Pacific are restricting flights, while Lion Air - one of the region's biggest airlines - is stopping flights to China from Saturday. Cathay Pacific has also suspended inflight trolley services, changed some aspects of its meal offer, and stopped giving out hot towels, pillows, blankets and magazines in an effort to prevent the virus spreading. China's national women's football team is being quarantined in Australia after arriving there to play in an Olympic qualifying tournament, Australian media report. Thirty-two players and staff will stay in isolation in a hotel in Brisbane as a precaution until 5 February, officials said. The team, which passed through Wuhan last week, had been due to play Thailand on 3 February. In another development, the furniture retailer Ikea said it was temporarily shutting half its 30 stores in China ""in response to the Chinese government's call for efficient control of the spread of the disease"". An expert from the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC) said it could take 10 more days for the outbreak to peak. The number of deaths from the virus has risen to 132 in China. Like the similar Sars and influenza viruses, the new coronavirus is a particular risk for elderly people and those with pre-existing illnesses. The sharp rise in cases is in part attributed to increased awareness, monitoring and testing in recent days. The number of cases of the new coronavirus has reached nearly 6,000 in China, surpassing the number of Sars cases in the country in the 2003 outbreak. The virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province. It causes severe acute respiratory infection and there is no specific cure or vaccine. A number of people, however, have recovered after treatment. Australia's 600 evacuees will be held on Christmas Island for two weeks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. The announcement sparked controversy as the island is best known for a recently reopened immigration detention centre, which was criticised for its conditions. Currently only housing one Sri Lankan family of four, the facility was built to accommodate more than 1,000 people. New Zealand will co-operate with Canberra to bring its 53 citizens home alongside the Australian evacuees. For over a week now, the Australians trapped in Wuhan - many of them children - have been calling on their government to help get them out. But the announcement of a two-week quarantine on Christmas Island have given many pause for thought. The external territory - closer to Indonesia than the Australian mainland - has long had a bad reputation. Since 2003, it's been one of the main places offshore where Australia detains asylum seekers, in conditions criticised by the UN. Chinese-Australians are also asking why their children are being sent miles away, as opposed to hospitals on the mainland. Some 200 Japanese nationals have been flown from Wuhan and have landed at Tokyo's Haneda airport. Around 650 others said they wanted to be repatriated, and the Japanese government said new flights were being planned. According to Japanese media, several of the returnees were suffering from fever or coughs. All will be taken to hospital, regardless of whether they are showing symptoms. They will then be tested in a quarantine ward before they can go home, and will be told not to leave their houses until the results are known. About 200 Americans - including workers from the local US consulate - are due to arrive in California after leaving Wuhan on an evacuation flight. CNN quotes health officials in Alaska, where the plane first landed on American soil, as saying they underwent health screenings and were then allowed to continue on to California. The UK Foreign Office is arranging the evacuation of about 200 Britons who wanted to leave the area. But some UK citizens have criticised the government, claiming lack of support for returning home. A flight carrying 250 French nationals is also expected to leave Wuhan; and Italy is planning a flight for more than 50 of its citizens on Thursday. South Korea said about 700 of its nationals would leave on four flights this week. Both Malaysia and the Philippines also said they would evacuate their citizens in and around Wuhan. Meanwhile, Hong Kong announced plans to slash cross-border travel between the city and mainland China. Wuhan - as well as the wider Hubei province - is already effectively in a lockdown with strict transport restrictions. Kazakhstan is closing all passenger travel with its neighbour and Papua New Guinea has announced that travellers from Asia will be barred from entering. Confirmations of person-to-person transmission in Germany, Vietnam, Taiwan and Japan - as opposed to travellers bringing the virus from China - have heightened concern about the spread of the virus. The United Arab Emirates has confirmed the first cases in the Middle East - a family who had recently arrived in the country from Wuhan. Leading Chinese respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan told Xinhua news agency: ""I think in one week or about 10 days, it will reach the climax and then there will be no large-scale increases."" China has agreed that the World Health Organization (WHO) will send international experts to the country.

"UAE confirms 4 Chinese tourists have virus, first in Mideast",https://apnews.com/e2145bb562ac9ee4a080af672b519068,2020-01-29,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — A family of four Chinese tourists in the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday became the first cases in the Mideast of a new Chinese virus that causes flu-like symptoms, with an Emirati doctor saying the first to fall ill only showed symptoms after over a week on vacation. Dr. Hussein al-Rand, an assistant undersecretary at the UAE’s Ministry of Health and Prevention, told The Associated Press that there was no reason to panic over virus. However, he acknowledged Emirati officials now were tracing the family’s steps since landing in this federation of seven sheikhdoms that includes Dubai and Abu Dhabi. “Their condition is stable, they are awake, they are all receiving all the measures,” al-Rand said. “I would say to the public: Please, don’t be panicked. The health condition within the United Arab Emirates is safe.” Among those sick in the family are a grandmother, her daughter, the daughter’s husband and the couple’s 9-year-old daughter, al-Rand said. The family from Wuhan, the epicenter of the viral outbreak, entered the UAE on Jan. 16, al-Rand said. He declined to name the airline the family flew on and the airport at which they arrived. The UAE is home to long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad Airways and is a hub for global air travel. Al-Rand also declined to say which cities they visited during their vacation. Authorities at Abu Dhabi’s airport and Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel, began screening passengers and crew from incoming China flights on Jan. 23. That’s the day China shut down Wuhan’s airport and other transportation in the city to stop the spread of the virus. The lockdown has since expanded to include 17 cities with more than 50 million people in all. That same day, Jan. 23, the grandmother among the family fell ill and sought medical care, al-Rand said. Public awareness about the virus had spread widely and doctors tested the grandmother for the new coronavirus and got a positive result. Authorities admitted the other three shortly after and they too tested positive. On Wednesday, six days after the grandmother fell ill, the UAE announced the cases, initially providing little information. They later confirmed the number of those ill and their nationality. The cases previously hadn’t been reported by the World Health Organization, which is keeping track of those who fall ill from the new virus. Emirati officials are taking “all the necessary precautions in accordance with the scientific recommendations, conditions and standards approved by the World Health Organization,” the Health and Prevention Ministry said. “The general health condition is not a cause for concern.” State-run and government-supporting media in the UAE carefully announced the news Wednesday, stressing that authorities said they had the situation under control. However, reports quickly emerged of face masks selling out at pharmacies as a popular online retailer had them as a top trending item. At Arab Health, a major trade show happening this week in Dubai, a few Emiratis and others attending wore surgical masks while walking among the crowds.  A few tourists also wore face masks while visiting sites in Dubai. Al-Rand declined to name the Emirati hospital the four now are receiving treatment. He also declined to say how many people Emirati health authorities had contacted while tracing the family’s travel in the UAE. Emirates meanwhile said it continued its flights to Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, as well as Hong Kong. “We are providing masks and hand sanitisers to all crew on our flights to China,” the company said in a statement. “Our crew who serve passengers with any symptoms have been advised to wear masks onboard.” The new type of coronavirus first appeared in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December. It causes flu-like symptoms, such as cough and fever and in severe cases pneumonia, that are similar to many other illnesses. It’s from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS. The viral outbreak that began in China has infected more than 6,000 people in the mainland and more than a dozen other countries. China’s death toll has passed 130. Several countries have confirmed cases of the virus, with most of them being Chinese visitors, people who visited Wuhan or family members in close contact with the sick. The source of the virus and the full extent of its spread are still unknown. However, the World Health Organization said most cases reported to date “have been milder, with around 20% of those infected experiencing severe illness.” Facing lower oil prices and a slumping housing market, the UAE has been aggressively pursuing more Chinese tourists to this country home to the world’s tallest building. Chinese visitors to the country can get visas on arrival to the UAE. Malls in Dubai now have Chinese on their signs alongside Arabic and English, with tour groups tramping through and high-end shoppers targeting luxury stores. Dubai alone welcomed 989,000 tourists from China in 2019, up 15% from 857,000 in 2018, according to the city-state’s tourism department.

RIGHT AT HOME: Reclaimed wood’s past adds character to decor,https://apnews.com/7db34f701d3f422bbe07020007da0c35,2020-01-29,"In their new book, ``Reclaimed Wood: A Field Guide’’ (Abrams, 2019), woodworkers Alan Solomon and Klaas Armster close with an imagined recounting of one tree’s story from sprout to salvage. The tale begins in the 1500s, when longleaf pine covered a vast area from North Carolina down to the tip of Texas and the Florida Panhandle — “the largest forested lands in North America,” the authors say. Over the next few hundred years, their pine tree grows to 120 feet. Naturally fire-resistant, it survives storms, woodpeckers, hunters and the Civil War, until it succumbs to loggers in the 1880s. The tree is then brought to a mill, shipped to New York, and taken by horse cart along cobblestone streets to lower Manhattan. For the next couple of hundred years, its wood frames commercial lofts that hold hat shops and daguerreotype salons. After demolition in the mid-2000s, the pine boards are salvaged by builders to clad the floors of the Park Avenue Armory and make gym bleachers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As the authors write, “the longleaf that had grown in the South and then went North, ultimately kept roots in both places.” The story describes what could be the life’s journey of many trees whose long-lasting wood was a primary building material in the development of towns and cities. These days, although many new buildings are made of concrete or brick, there’s a resurgence in using reclaimed wood in everything from ceiling beams to feature walls, furniture, flooring or exterior cladding. Architects and designers appreciate the narrative that salvaged wood brings to a project, and the physical charm of planed boards with the patina and markings of their life stories. Solomon and Armster run Sawkill Lumber in Brooklyn, New York, supplying wood salvaged from barns, commercial and industrial sites, and homes to architects, contractors and woodworkers. Sometimes their hardwoods or softwoods are left in their natural state, but the team also ``rehabs’’ beams and boards by refinishing, sanding and giving them coats of protective stains, oils or waxes. In one case, Solomon says, they acquired wood from dismantled Worcestershire sauce tanks at an old Lea & Perrins plant in New Jersey. “The wood is high-quality, old-growth Douglas fir, free of knots, with a strong scent of sauce after re-sawing,” says Solomon, who used some of the wood to clad his own home. The Hudson Company, which has a mill and showroom in Pine Plains, New York, and showrooms in Manhattan and Ridgefield, Connecticut, salvages timbers and boards from various cities’ water towers, industrial buildings and agrarian structures. It has also salvaged framing from mushroom farms; the woods — mostly hemlock and cypress — develop unique characteristics over the fungi’s growth cycle. Company president Jamie Hammel likes the idea that the wood, often used as paneling in residential and commercial projects, is salvaged from an ongoing agricultural process. “So, in a sense it’s a renewable resource, because the farmers are continuously updating and replacing the boards from the growing beds. In addition, the caramel color wood tones, fine grain, and sculptural textures offer a unique aesthetic,’’ he says. Jonah Meyer, who owns Sawkille Company, a furniture design studio in Rhinebeck, New York, praises heart pine for its ``wonderful stripes. Heart pines come from the beams of America’s first factories, and of course, these were old growth forests that were being cut. Old growth also means slow growth; the rings of the trees are very tight. Nothing grows like that anymore.” Meyer crafts chairs, tables and other furniture, some of which he paints with woodland scenes or decorative motifs. When nature sends something his way, he’ll make the most of it. “Occasionally we find a huge tree that has come down in a storm, so we cut it up for coffee tables and start drying the pieces. They’re amazing to work with — some are almost 45 inches across,’’ he says. ``Over time we get to know the tree, and it’s a good feeling to have saved it from the firewood pile.”",Associated Press News,"Heart pines come from the beams of America’s first factories, and of course, these were old growth forests that were being cut.

Court: Motorcyclist wrong to turn license plate upside down,https://apnews.com/98645ff6ddb206af3e926753fb36dc4c,2020-01-29,"TRENTON, N.J. (AP) — A motorcyclist cited for turning his license plate upside down because he thought “it was cool” has lost another bid to rescind a traffic ticket he received. In a ruling issued Tuesday, a state appellate court determined that the ticket and the $139 penalty Scott DiRoma received in municipal court were both justified. The ruling upheld a decision issued by a Somerset County judge. DiRoma was driving his motorcycle in Warren Township in June 2018 when he was stopped by a police officer who noticed his license plate was mounted upside down. DiRoma told the officer he liked the way the plate looked and “wanted to be different,” authorities have said. A municipal court judge eventually imposed a $106 fine and $33 in court costs after DiRoma was found guilty of violating a state law mandating that license plates be kept clear and distinct. DiRoma appealed that decision, arguing that the law doesn’t prohibit an upside-down license plate on a motorcycle because lawmakers drew a distinction between motorcycle and automobile plates. He also claimed the law is unconstitutionally vague. The county judge, though, found that lawmakers did not intend for drivers to mount their license plates upside down because it would impact law enforcement’s ability to protect the public on roadways. In rejecting DiRoma’s claims, the appellate court ruled an upside-down plate on any type of vehicle causes the reader to view characters in reverse order, which would lead to confusion, doubt, and mistake. That would clearly impede law enforcement’s ability to perform its duties, the judges wrote. A telephone number for DiRoma, who represented himself, could not be located Wednesday. It’s not known if the Somerset County man will appeal his case to the New Jersey Supreme Court.",Associated Press News,"The county judge, though, found that lawmakers did not intend for drivers to mount their license plates upside down because it would impact law enforcement’s ability to protect the public on roadways.

"Fun-loving TEs Kelce, Kittle the life of Super Bowl party",https://apnews.com/af650d3064db8d9b8fbd5dd1f460ed76,2020-01-29,"MIAMI (AP) — They’ve got swagger, style and lots and lots of catches. Kansas City’s Travis Kelce and San Francisco’s George Kittle are talkative tight ends at this year’s Super Bowl and among the most entertaining personalities in the NFL — Rob Gronkowski-types who could play big roles in who wins the big game Sunday. “I just love to live life, man,” Kelce said with a big smile. “And I like to enjoy happiness along the way.” That comes from a guy whose silly, entertaining, ridiculous, hilarious — or, all of the above — dances to celebrate his touchdowns instantly go viral moments after he gets into the end zone. The 6-foot-5, 260-pound Kelce has “Hit the Quan” and done “The Chicken Head” and everything in between. He’s the life of a football party that has moved to the NFL’s biggest stage — and with a worldwide audience watching. “I just think any time he gets the ball in the end zone, I ask him all the time, ‘How do you come up with these dances, man? Just how do you come up with all this stuff?’” said Chiefs offensive tackle Eric Fisher, who was fined $14,037 for dumping two beers on himself while celebrating a touchdown in Kansas City’s divisional round win over Houston. “I don’t know, man,” Fisher added. “I think his touchdown celebrations are one of a kind and will go down in history.” Kelce is also doing a pretty good job of getting himself into the record books with his play. He holds the NFL record for the most seasons by a tight end with 1,000 or more yards receiving with four, and counting. Kelce is a favorite target of Patrick Mahomes and established himself as possibly the best all-around tight end in the game. “Kelce’s a beast,” Chiefs wide receiver Tyreek Hill said. “He’s special. I’ve never seen a guy that size to have that much ability or to carry that kind of swagger. He’s definitely a leader.” The 49ers say the same of the playmaking Kittle, who was selected a first-team All-Pro this season. The third-year tight end has had 85 catches or more and 1,000 yards receiving in each of his past two years. Kittle is a fun-loving character whose approach to the game mimics that of a playful professional wrestler. After all, his nickname is “Stone Cold Kittle” — after “Stone Cold” Steve Austin. He even uses a gesture to celebrate first downs that he borrowed from Pentagón Jr., a Mexican wrestler. He makes a circle with his thumb and forefinger to form a “0” and then flicks his wrist so his other fingers form an “M” for Pentagón Jr.’s catch phrase: “Cero miedo,” which means, “zero fear.” “I think we’re all a little different, but he’s unique and you see it on the field,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. “He has a personality where he goes 100 mph in whatever he does. That’s probably why he’s going to have a WWE career after this. What’s cool is that’s kind of who he is and then you see it on the field. That’s why whether he does perfect or not, he always makes plays with his attitude when the ball is in his hands.” That all started when Kittle was in college at Iowa, where then-tight ends coach Levar Woods gave him homework. The assignment: Watch videos of the best players at the position and take anything he can use to add to his game. Kittle couldn’t stop looking at film of Kelce, filling his iPad with film of the Chiefs star. Every play, every game. “Whether it’s what he does in the red zone, how he runs his routes, his mindset every time he steps on the football field. I think the thing that really kind of stands out the most is you see his personality when he plays and how much fun he has,” Kittle said. “Very similar to Gronk and his personality, the way it shows. I think they just kind of opened the door for tight ends like me to be able to express ourselves on the football field.” Or, off it. Kittle is an affable guy who’s always smiling and cracking jokes. After the 49ers’ victory over Green Bay in the NFC championship game, the tight end walked around doing TV interviews while wearing a T-shirt of a bare-chested quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo that a fan sent to him. Of course, photos and video went viral. Just like his first-down celebrations. “I think we both have a really good time playing football,” Kittle said. “You can see that on the tape. We both just enjoy being out there with our teammates. We both make plays when we’re asked to, and I think we both make plays when we’re not asked to.” They’ve also been able to make plays when they aren’t there. Last season, Kittle had the most yards after catch since the stat began being tracked in 2010 with 870. He ranked first this season among non-running backs with 602. “One guy shouldn’t bring us down,” the 6-4, 245-pound Kittle said. “And if you have that mindset, where you’re going to run through someone’s face, it definitely makes the YAC a lot easier.” Kelce isn’t too shabby, either, ranking third among tight ends with 410 yards after catch. “I do believe the run after catch is something I’ve been able to have a knack since I have been in the league,” Kelce said. “Obviously, since Kittle has been in the league, he’s taken that to a whole other level.” The two tight ends are far from one-dimensional. They do more than their fair share of blocking, too, while contributing to their teams’ running games. They’ll hit defenders with a smile. And, then show off some dance moves. “I think we’re both positive guys,” Kelce said with a big smile. “We both love to play the game and, at the same time, we both love life.” AP Pro Football Writers Josh Dubow and Barry Wilner, and AP Sports Writer Dave Skretta contributed.

Virus cases in China top SARS as evacuations begin,https://apnews.com/a980aeb44b3840341c674a6e67c19da6,2020-01-29,"BEIJING (AP) — Countries began evacuating their citizens Wednesday from the Chinese city hardest-hit by a new virus that has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by SARS. The number of confirmed cases jumped to 5,974, surpassing the 5,327 in mainland China during the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003. The death toll rose to 132, which is still lower than the 348 people who were killed in China by SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Scientists say there are still many questions to be answered about the new virus, including just how transmissible and severe it is. Chartered planes carrying about 200 evacuees each arrived in Japan and the United States early Wednesday as other countries planned similar evacuations from the city of Wuhan, which authorities have shut down to try to contain the virus. The first cases in the Middle East were confirmed Wednesday, a family of four from Wuhan that was visiting the United Arab Emirates. Airlines around the world announced they were cutting flights to China, and Hong Kong was suspending rail travel to and from the mainland at midnight. The number of cases in China rose 1,459 from the previous day, a smaller increase than the 1,771 new cases reported Tuesday. Australia and Singapore were among those reporting new cases, as the number outside China topped 70. The vast majority are people who came from Wuhan. Four passengers on the evacuation flight to Japan had coughs and fevers, and two were diagnosed with pneumonia. It wasn’t clear whether they were infected with the new virus, which first appeared in Wuhan in December. Its symptoms, including cough and fever and in severe cases pneumonia, are similar to many other illnesses. Takeo Aoyama, an employee at Nippon Steel Corp.’s subsidiary in Wuhan, told reporters he was relieved to be able to return home. “We were feeling increasingly uneasy as the situation developed so rapidly and we were still in the city,” Aoyama said, his voice muffled by a white surgical mask. The U.S. plane was headed to California after a refueling stop in Alaska. All 201 passengers, who included diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, passed health screenings in China and Anchorage. Australia, New Zealand and Britain were among the latest countries to announce they are planning evacuations. British Airways said it was suspending all flights to and from mainland China after the U.K. government warned against unnecessary travel to the country. The airline has daily flights from London to Shanghai and Beijing. British health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that “anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.” The measures are a step up from those during the devastating 2014-16 Ebola outbreak, when returning travelers from West Africa were asked to monitor themselves for symptoms. Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh, said the steps are justified to prevent the introduction of the virus and its spread. “There’s always a balance between the draconian measures of public health and what people might want to do, and obviously it’s regrettable if people who turn out not to have the virus are quarantined unnecessarily,” he said. The outbreak has affected international sporting events. The International Hockey Federation postponed Pro League games in China, and soccer, basketball and boxing qualifiers for the Tokyo Olympics in February have been moved outside of the country. In Australia, health officials said the Chinese women’s national soccer team was quarantined in the city of Brisbane because it had passed through Wuhan a week ago. The team will be kept in isolation in a hotel until Jan. 5. None of the 32 players and staff has shown symptoms. In China’s Hubei province, 17 cities including Wuhan have been locked down, trapping more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed. Sara Platto, an Italian animal behavior researcher and veterinarian, said there were 25 Italians stuck in Wuhan, who stay in touch online for material and emotional support. “My son turned 12 on January 23, the first day of the lockdown in Wuhan. So he couldn’t invite his friends over. We had a remote birthday celebration, with people ‘visiting’ him over WeChat,” Platto said, referring to a Chinese messaging app. “We called it the epidemic birthday.” As much as panic, people spending most of their times indoors have to deal with boredom. Her son Matteo usually has a very busy agenda between his school, sports, and volunteer work, but now “it’s like suddenly everything has slowed down,” Platto said. As with other international schools, classes are moving online until the all-clear is sounded. The new virus is from the coronavirus family, which includes those that can cause the common cold as well as more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS. As of December, MERS had sickened nearly 2,500 people since its identification in 2012. The source of the new virus and the full extent of its spread are still unknown. However, the World Health Organization said most cases reported to date “have been milder, with around 20% of those infected experiencing severe illness.” Scientists expect many crucial questions about the virus’ behavior will be answered in the coming weeks as the outbreak evolves and it becomes clearer how people are infected. Although the Chinese health minister and others have suggested that the virus is spreading before people get symptoms, data to confirm that has not yet been shared widely beyond China. “It’s still unclear whether that takes place,” said Malik Peiris, chair in virology at the University of Hong Kong. If it does, that might explain why China has already exceeded the case numbers for SARS. “The fortunate thing about SARS, if there was anything fortunate, was that transmission did not take place before symptoms,” he said. Peiris said that if it turns out that the new coronavirus can indeed be spread by people who don’t show any symptoms, “a pandemic is a scenario that we have to consider.” Associated Press writers Christina Larson in Washington, D.C., and Jill Lawless and Maria Cheng in London contributed to this report.",Associated Press News,"British health secretary Matt Hancock tweeted that “anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.” The measures are a step up from those during the devastating 2014-16 Ebola outbreak, when returning travelers from West Africa were asked to monitor themselves for symptoms. Although the Chinese health minister and others have suggested that the virus is spreading before people get symptoms, data to confirm that has not yet been shared widely beyond China. However, the World Health Organization said most cases reported to date “have been milder, with around 20% of those infected experiencing severe illness.” Scientists expect many crucial questions about the virus’ behavior will be answered in the coming weeks as the outbreak evolves and it becomes clearer how people are infected."
EU stops short of recommending ban on China’s Huawei,https://apnews.com/dca6b6b34084bf2ecce85db41a1e77c3,2020-01-29,"LONDON (AP) — The European Union unveiled security guidelines for next generation high-speed wireless networks that stop short of calling for a ban on Huawei, in the latest setback for the U.S. campaign against the Chinese tech company. The EU’s executive Commission on Wednesday outlined a set of strategic and technical measures aimed at reducing cybersecurity risks from fifth-generation, or 5G, mobile networks. The recommendations include blocking high-risk equipment suppliers from “critical and sensitive” parts of the network, including the core, which keeps track of data and authenticates smartphones connecting to cell towers. No companies were mentioned by name but the term “high risk” supplier was an obvious reference to Huawei , the world’s top maker of telecom infrastructure equipment such as routers, switches and antennas — the hidden plumbing through which wireless companies’ internet data traffic flows. The guidance in the EU’s “toolbox” for 5G is aimed at helping national governments handle the technical challenges and geopolitical controversy involving Huawei as they prepare to build new telecom infrastructure costing billions of dollars. But it will be up to individual countries to decide what kind of role Huawei will play. “As many critical services will depend on 5G, ensuring the security of our networks is of high strategic importance for the entire European Union,” the EU’s executive vice president overseeing digital strategy, Margrethe Vestager, said at a press briefing in Brussels. The U.S. has been lobbying European allies to ban Huawei, over concerns it could be compelled to help with electronic eavesdropping after Beijing enacted a 2017 national intelligence law. U.S. officials also worry that 5G networks would rely heavily on software, leaving them open to vulnerabilities, and  have repeatedly warned they would have to reconsider intelligence sharing with allies that use Huawei. The company has denied the allegations. The measures are similar to those taken a day earlier by Britain, which also opted not to introduce an outright ban on Huawei , disappointing the Trump administration. Instead, the British government prohibited it  from supplying equipment used in the core, while limiting its role supplying antennas and base stations for the less sensitive “radio access network.” “Our view of Huawei is putting it in your system creates real risk,” said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was due to arrive in London Wednesday to meet British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other officials. Pompeo said the U.S. would evaluate the U.K. policy “but our view is we should have Western systems with Western rules and American information should only pass across a trusted network.” New 5G networks are expected to drive the next wave of innovation, transmitting massive amounts of data at super-fast speeds from more objects and locations. They would, for example, help make possible “smart” robotic factories. The recommendations are “based on an objective assessment of risks and a balanced set of possible measures,” Vestager said. “They apply across the board and do not target any specific country or company.” Under the guidelines, the “risk profile” of an equipment supplier, including the likelihood it is “subject to interference from a non-EU country,” should be taken into account. Huawei competes mainly with two European rivals, Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson. The Commission wants EU member countries to implement the guidelines by April 30. Huawei said it welcomed the EU decision. “This non-biased and fact-based approach towards 5G security allows Europe to have a more secure and faster 5G network,” the company said, adding it has been operating in Europe for nearly two decades and has a “proven track record” in security. The EU recommendations also include tightening security requirements for wireless companies and making sure they have a strategy to buy gear from more than one supplier. Europe is poised to poised to start rolling out 5G, with wireless companies expected to launch service in 138 cities across the bloc by the end of the year.

Report: No sign of fight before officer shot handcuffed man,https://apnews.com/1d543171e011db452f30ada539e68a95,2020-01-29,"COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) — Investigators didn’t find any evidence of a fight between a Maryland police officer and the handcuffed man he is accused of fatally shooting in the front passenger seat of his patrol car, police said in a report on a murder charge against the officer. Prince George’s County Police Cpl. Michael Owen Jr. fired seven shots at William Howard Green and struck him multiple times, said the report on Monday’s shooting. Owen had handcuffed Green, 43, of Washington, D.C., behind his back and placed him in the cruiser after responding to a traffic accident and finding him sleeping in his vehicle, apparently under the influence of an unknown substance, said the report released Wednesday. About five to 10 minutes after Owen placed Green in his cruiser, a witness heard gunshots and saw the wounded man still seated in the front passenger seat with his hands cuffed behind his back, police said. Investigators did not find any weapons in Green’s possession or in his vehicle. Witnesses told officers Green had struck their vehicle, police said in a news release. Owen a 10-year veteran of the force, was arrested Tuesday on charges of second-degree murder, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, first-degree assault and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence. Owen, 31, of Accokeek, Maryland, is scheduled to appear in court on Wednesday afternoon for a hearing on whether he can be freed on bail. Prince George’s County Police Chief Hank Stawinski said during a news conference Tuesday that he asked his special investigations response team to file the charges. Stawinski called the announcement the most difficult of his tenure as police chief. “I am unable to come to our community this evening and provide you with a reasonable explanation for the events that occurred last night,” the chief told reporters. “I concluded that what happened last night is a crime.” During an earlier news conference, police department spokeswoman Christina Cotterman had said two witnesses told police they either saw or heard a struggle before the shooting. Cotterman also said officers smelled PCP and believed the man was under the influence of that drug. However, Stawinski later said PCP did not appear to have been involved and that no account of a struggle in the cruiser could be corroborated. “There are no circumstances under which this outcome is acceptable,” Stawinski said. “You have my assurance that all our methods and practices will be examined as this investigation proceeds.” The shooting wasn’t caught on body-camera video because the officer didn’t have one, police said. Investigators were looking for surveillance cameras in the area that may have recorded the shooting. In a news release, police said a department directive permits officers to transport arrested suspects in the front passenger seat of patrol cars that don’t have partitions. Owen’s cruiser did not have a partition. Owen had been placed on administrative leave prior to the announcement that charges would be filed against him. Owen is black. A police department spokeswoman wouldn’t specify Green’s race, citing department policy. Owen has been involved in at least two other shootings during his time on the force. In 2011, he fatally shot a man who pointed a gun at him after Owen left an event at police headquarters, the department said. Owen was placed on administrative leave after that incident, but there is no indication whether additional action was taken. In 2009, Owen was off-duty when someone tried to rob him outside his home, The Washington Post reported. Police officials said the would-be robber fired, but Owen was not hit and returned fire. The assailant fled, according to police. Prince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy said in a statement Tuesday that her office will conduct a “thorough and independent investigation.” “We will seek truth, and will vigorously pursue justice in a way that is fair and responsible,” Braveboy said. “Once we have received all information and completed our own investigation and analysis, I assure you that my office will be transparent and accountable to the public about our findings and how we will move forward.” Deborah Jeon, legal director for the the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, said in a statement that there is no reason for an officer to shoot a handcuffed suspect multiple times inside a patrol car. Jeon called it “completely unacceptable” that Prince George’s County’s police department doesn’t equip all its officers with body cameras. “These deaths are completely preventable,” Jeon said. “Police characterize them as unavoidable, but they are not. And body camera footage will show that.”",Associated Press News,"“Once we have received all information and completed our own investigation and analysis, I assure you that my office will be transparent and accountable to the public about our findings and how we will move forward.” Deborah Jeon, legal director for the the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, said in a statement that there is no reason for an officer to shoot a handcuffed suspect multiple times inside a patrol car. “I concluded that what happened last night is a crime.” During an earlier news conference, police department spokeswoman Christina Cotterman had said two witnesses told police they either saw or heard a struggle before the shooting.

Weinstein accuser says ‘I was in shock’ over alleged assault,https://apnews.com/8fc80c6e9e7c45bd05c66395c19f888d,2020-01-29,"NEW YORK (AP) — A woman who described herself as an aspiring actress and big fan of Harvey Weinstein’s films told jurors Wednesday that she jumped at his invitation to screen-test for movie roles. At a subsequent meeting in a New York City hotel suite, Dawn Dunning testified, Weinstein led her to a bedroom, put his hand up her skirt and fondled her genitals. “I stood up. I was in shock,” Dunning said, fighting back tears as she recounted the 2004 encounter. “He just started talking really fast. He said, ‘Don’t make a big deal about this. It will never happen again.’” Asked by prosecutor Meghan Hast whether she was gaining anything by testifying at Weinstein’s rape trial, Dunning responded: “No, if anything I’m losing. This is the worst and hardest thing I’ve ever done.” Dunning, now 40, is one of several women whom prosecutors are calling to the witness stand to testify about experiences with Weinstein that, while not part of the underlying criminal charges, could be a big factor in whether he goes to prison at the end of the landmark #MeToo-era trial. Tarale Wulff, an aspiring actress who met Weinstein in 2005 while working as a cocktail server at one of his favorite Manhattan haunts, is expected to testify later Wednesday. She alleges he once cornered her in a hallway and started masturbating and on another occasion pushed her onto a bed and raped her. Manhattan prosecutors are having Dunning, Wulff and a third woman testify as part of their effort to portray Weinstein as a serial offender. State law allows such testimony about so-called “prior bad acts” to explore things like motive, opportunity, intent and a common scheme or plan. Jurors have already heard from actress Annabella Sciorra, who testified that Weinstein overpowered and raped her after barging into her apartment in the mid-1990s. Weinstein, 67, is charged with forcing oral sex on Mimi Haleyi in 2006, at the time a “Project Runway” production assistant, and in 2013 raping another aspiring actress, who could testify later this week. He has insisted any sexual encounters were consensual, and Weinstein’s lawyers zeroed in on his accusers’ continued contact with him after the alleged assaults. The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they have been victims of sexual assault, unless they agree to be named or gone public with their stories, as Haleyi, Wulff, Dunning and Sciorra have done. Dunning said she met Weinstein while waiting tables at a Manhattan nightclub where bottle service was a trend for the rich and famous. Weinstein immediately appeared to take an interest in her fledgling acting career, she said, and invited her to a lunch meeting where, noting his infamous temper, she said he was “on the phone a lot yelling at people.” Dunning, who first told her story to The New York Times in October 2017, said Weinstein also offered her a screen test at his film studio offices and even arranged to get Broadway tickets for her and her boyfriend. Several meetings followed, she said, including one at a boutique hotel in Manhattan’s SoHo neighborhood where Weinstein was using a suite as a temporary office. At one point, Dunning testified, Weinstein led her into a bedroom and they sat down on the bed. “I was wearing a skirt that day and he put his hand up my skirt,” she testified. “There was no red flags or alerts that would make me expect it to happen.” Dunning said she “just kind of gave him the benefit of the doubt” when Weinstein said it would never happen again. She said she didn’t scream or yell and didn’t tell anyone because she was embarrassed and didn’t want to be a victim. Dunning said that she later agreed to meet Weinstein at a cigar bar, but that an assistant took her to a suite where the “Pulp Fiction” producer was standing in a bathrobe. There, she said, Weinstein showed her a contract for three movie roles she would get on the condition she had “a threesome with his assistant.” “When he said that I laughed. I thought he was kidding,” Dunning said. “He got really angry; he started screaming, ‘You’ll never make in this business. This is how the industry works.’” “He was a big guy; he was towering over me. I was really scared,” Dunning testified. She didn’t call police, she said, because she didn’t know whether what he did was a crime. Jurors have also heard a tearful Haleyi recall how she tried to fight off Weinstein before he sexually assaulted her. On Tuesday, Haleyi’s former roommate, Elizabeth Entin, took the stand to corroborate the testimony.",Associated Press News,"Weinstein immediately appeared to take an interest in her fledgling acting career, she said, and invited her to a lunch meeting where, noting his infamous temper, she said he was “on the phone a lot yelling at people.” Dunning, who first told her story to The New York Times in October 2017, said Weinstein also offered her a screen test at his film studio offices and even arranged to get Broadway tickets for her and her boyfriend.

More airlines drop flights to China as deadly virus spreads ,https://apnews.com/79c7725141c037c5326edcadee6cc4e8,2020-01-29,"BANGKOK (AP) — British Airways halted all flights to China and American Airlines suspended Los Angeles flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing as efforts to contain a new and deadly virus intensifies. The coronavirus has now infected more people in China than were sickened in the country by the SARS outbreak in 2002-2003. The number of confirmed cases jumped to 5,974, surpassing the 5,327 in mainland China from SARS. The virus has killed more than 130 people. The British and U.S. carriers on Wednesday joined several Asian carriers that are either suspending or significantly cutting back service there as fears spread about the coronavirus. Air India and South Korean budget carrier Seoul Air are also halting all flights to the country, and Indonesia’s Lion Air plans to do the same. Other carriers including Finnair, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, and Singapore-based Jetstar Asia are slashing service. Beyond disrupting travel, the move will heighten concerns about the broader economic impact  of the virus outbreak. Hotels, airlines, casinos and cruise operators are among the industries suffering the most immediate repercussions, especially in countries close to China. BA said it was immediately suspending all flights to and from mainland China after the U.K. government warned against unnecessary travel to the country amid a virus outbreak. The airline operates daily flights from London’s Heathrow Airport to Shanghai and Beijing. It took the measure a day after Britain’s Foreign Office updated its travel advice on China, warning against “all but essential travel” to the mainland, not including Hong Kong and Macao. The U.S. has not put into place travel restrictions, though Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said “it’s important to not take anything off the table,” when he was asked about that potential. American Airlines said Wednesday it will suspend flights between Los Angeles and both Shanghai and Beijing from Feb. 9 through Mar. 27. The airline cited “the significant decline in demand for travel to and from China.” Flights from Dallas-Fort Worth will continue, the airline said. China has cut off access to the central city of Wuhan, epicenter of the outbreak, and 16 other cities to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further. That has trapped  more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed. The outbreak has infected more than 6,000 on the mainland and abroad. -Air Seoul, a budget airline, became the first South Korean airline to suspend its fights to mainland Chinese destinations apart from Wuhan, stopping its flights to the cities of Zhangjiajie and Linyi. -Indonesia’s Lion Air said it has canceled more than 50 flights to China well into February. The flights are from five international airports in Manado, Surabaya, Jakarta, Batam and from Denpasar, in Bali, to 15 airports in China. The suspension will be phased in gradually and continue until further notice. -Hong Kong airlines are cutting the number of their flights to the mainland by about half through the end of March in response to government virus-control efforts. -Cathay Pacific Group said flights to 24 mainland destinations would be reduced to 240 weekly. The company owns Cathay Pacific Airways, cargo carrier Air Hong Kong, Cathay Dragon and Hong Kong Express. -Air India is suspending Delhi-Shanghai flights, which operate six times a week, from Friday until Feb. 14. -Finland’s Finnair, which has actively promoted its position linking Asian and Western destinations, said it was canceling three weekly flights to Beijing Daxing International Airport through late March, as well as its twice-weekly flights to Nanjing. -Jetstar Asia will temporarily suspend flights to the Chinese cities of Hefei, Guiyang and Xuzhou starting Thursday through the end of March due to a drop in demand. -South Korea’s second-largest carrier, Asiana Airlines, will temporarily suspend flights to the Chinese cities of Guilin, Changsha and Haikou starting next month. -Korean Air, South Korea’s biggest airline, said it is also considering grounding some of its flights to mainland China as passenger demand drops. Korean Air had operated four flights a week to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, before suspending them on Jan. 23. -Taiwan’s Eva Air announced a partial cancellation of flights to and from mainland China for two weeks starting Feb. 2. In addition, the airline also has stopped providing towels, magazines, table clothes, and is limiting use of blankets and pillows on its flights. -Kazakhstan, which shares a long border with far western China, announced Wednesday that it plans to suspend all flights, train and bus traffic and to halt issuing visas to Chinese nationals. Before the Wednesday’s suspension, there were 24 flights a week from Kazakhstan to China, including a daily flight to Ürümqi, the capital of Xinjiang. -Japan’s JAL said it had not changed its flight plans, while German carrier Lufthansa said it was monitoring the situation “very closely” and would if necessary make changes in consultation with the authorities.

Sanders builds a deeper Jewish identity on the 2020 trail,https://apnews.com/38d217df36e903a671089dfb4e669218,2020-01-29,"NEW YORK (AP) — Bernie Sanders is approaching next week’s Iowa caucuses in a position to become the first major-party Jewish presidential nominee in the nation’s history. And at a time of resurgent anti-Semitism, he’s talking in more depth about how his faith shapes his broader worldview. Soon after the one-year anniversary of the massacre at Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue, Sanders penned a column on combating anti-Semitism that outlined how his family’s history underpins his commitment to fight bigotry. After five New York Jews were stabbed while celebrating Hanukkah last month, Sanders used an Iowa menorah-lighting stop to connect his immigrant father’s journey to America, “fleeing anti-Semitism and fleeing violence,” to ideals he described as imperiled by attacks on Jews -- and other minority groups. Just last week, Sanders tweeted  a video featuring his campaign’s Jewish outreach director, Joel Rubin, discussing the Vermont senator’s “intrinsically Jewish values.” Sanders has described his pride in being Jewish since his first Democratic presidential run in 2016. But he’s known more for detaching from organized religion than embracing faith, and his model of Jewish American candidacy -- aligning with “the tradition of Jewish social justice” while criticizing Israeli government policy toward Palestinians -- breaks the mold cast by observant Jew Joseph Lieberman, the Democrats’ vice-presidential nominee 20 years ago. Sanders’ increased engagement with his Jewishness comes as a Democratic super PAC unveils a six-figure ad campaign in Iowa challenging his candidacy and raising questions about his health. Sanders “doesn’t buy into that concept of anti-Semitism and Jewish identity as defined by Israel,” said Rubin, who joined the campaign earlier this month, in an interview. The 78-year-old democratic socialist connected his Jewishness to his liberal policies during remarks last fall to J Street, a progressive Jewish American group whose conference drew five Democratic presidential candidates. “If there’s any group on earth that should be trying to bring people together around a common and progressive agenda, it is the Jewish people,” Sanders said, adding that he believes in Israel’s “right to exist in peace and security” and would extend the same right to Palestinians. Sanders later raised a topic that promises to complicate his unifying vision of Jewish American values. Blasting conservative Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he told the audience: “It is not anti-Semitism to say that the Netanyahu government has been racist.” Sanders is hardly alone among Democrats in opposing Netanyahu’s bid to annex West Bank settlements. But if Sanders prevails in the crowded Democratic presidential field -- which includes moderate Jewish rival Michael Bloomberg -- he’ll face a president in Donald Trump whose messages about anti-Semitism and Jewish identity are closely connected to the Israeli government. Trump signed an executive order last month that stoked debate over when criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti-Semitism. The president also continues to embrace Netanyahu, releasing a Middle East peace plan alongside him on Tuesday, and last year said Jews who vote for Democrats are disloyal to their religion as well as Israel. If Sanders is pitted against Trump, who would court Jewish votes as an ally of Netanyahu’s government, the senator would have to carve out more nuanced terrain as a proud Jewish critic of that government. Bloomberg offers a contrasting approach, declaring on Sunday that he “will always have Israel’s back” in a speech that poked at Sanders’ 1960s volunteer stint on a leftist kibbutz in Israel. Rubin acknowledged that Sanders is on the outside of legacy Jewish groups that view supporting Israel as sacrosanct. “The Jewish establishment has a hard time looking at a Jewish politician who stands up for Jewish rights and makes it a Jewish American argument first,” said Rubin, who was J Street’s founding political director. But he asserted that “the predominant majority of American Jews” agree with Sanders. A survey last year by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that 42% of Jewish Americans said Trump favors Israel too much. A similar share of Jewish Americans, 47%, said Trump strikes the right balance. Even as Israel remains a polarizing topic, Sanders’ candidacy underlines a point that many Jews can agree on: Jewishness means different things to different people, presidential candidates included. “The Jewish community is not a monolith,” Rabbi Hara Person, the Central Conference of American Rabbis’ chief executive, said by email. “It is certainly an important sign of progress in our country that Sanders is comfortable talking about and embracing his Jewish identity in the 2020 election and encompassing it as a value of who he is as a candidate,” added Person, who said she is not endorsing Sanders. Halie Soifer, who heads the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said that Sanders “identified himself in a way most American Jews can relate to” by linking his faith to his progressive agenda. “Where there’s a robust debate in our community relates to his policies on Israel, and in that regard, I don’t know that his Judaism really comes into play,” added Soifer, whose group is not endorsing a Democratic primary candidate. Jewish Americans tend to vote Democratic, even as Trump continues his outreach. According to AP VoteCast, 72% of Jewish voters backed Democratic House candidates in 2018 and 74% disapproved of Trump’s handling of his job. Rubin described his job with the Sanders campaign as three-fold, energizing Sanders’ existing Jewish American supporters while also fielding challenges on high-priority Jewish issues and convincing new supporters that Sanders’ perspective is worth their time. He may have a particularly tough road ahead with Jewish groups alienated by Sanders’ use of campaign surrogates who have made polarizing remarks about Israel-Palestinian relations. Among those divisive figures is Muslim-American activist Linda Sarsour, who last month had to clarify her remarks after saying that Israel “is built on the idea that Jews are supreme to everyone else.” Among the prominent Jewish Americans who pushed back was the CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, who tweeted  that her remarks were “anti-Semitism plain and simple.” Mark Mellman, a longtime Democratic strategist who heads the group Democratic Majority for Israel, said that “it’s fair to say (Sanders) is greatly concerned by” rising anti-Semitism. But he warned that Sanders’ use of surrogates whose remarks on Israel have offended some Jewish Americans reflects a blind spot. “There’s something wrong with somebody who professes to be concerned about anti-Semitism” but won’t disavow it when it comes from within his own camp, Mellman said. His group’s separate political action committee is spending six figures on the Iowa airwaves against Sanders this week, running an ad that does not mention Israel but raises doubts about the candidate’s health after a heart attack last fall. Sanders cited the ads in a Tuesday video tweeted to rally supporters. Associated Press religion coverage receives support from the Lilly Endowment through the Religion News Foundation.

Hall of Fame DE Doleman dies at age 58,https://apnews.com/2d20863dd89a02746dc67659c9364f92,2020-01-29,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Hall of Fame defensive end Chris Doleman, whose enviable blend of speed and power made him one of the NFL’s most feared pass rushers during 15 seasons in the league, has died. The longtime Minnesota Vikings star, who had 150½ career sacks to rank fifth on the all-time list, was 58. The Vikings and the Pro Football Hall of Fame expressed their condolences in separate statements confirming Doleman’s death on Tuesday night. Doleman had surgery two years ago to remove a brain tumor after being diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive type of cancer that killed U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona in 2018. The diagnosis and surgery kept Doleman from attending Super Bowl 52 in Minneapolis, requiring a five-week hospital stay in Atlanta, but later that year he was able to travel to Canton, Ohio, for the Hall of Fame induction ceremony that included former teammate Randy Moss. That fall, he married his wife, LaTresa Doleman, and they traveled to Minnesota together for the team’s Ring of Honor induction ceremony for the late Dennis Green, one of his coaches with the Vikings. “Just the thought of catching up with everybody pulls you through those dark times,” Doleman said then in an interview with the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Doleman returned to U.S. Bank Stadium as recently as last October, for the Ring of Honor induction for former teammate Steve Jordan. Former teammate and fellow Hall of Famer Randall McDaniel pushed Doleman to and from the on-field ceremony in a wheelchair. Doleman, an Indianapolis native who played in college at Pittsburgh before being drafted by the Vikings with the fourth overall pick in 1985, was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2012. He converted from linebacker to defensive end and spent his first nine seasons with the Vikings, collecting a league-high 21 sacks in 1989 while forming a fierce pass-rushing tandem with defensive tackle Keith Millard, who had 18 sacks himself that year for the NFC North champions. He was a two-time first-team All-Pro and eight-time Pro Bowl selection who played in 232 of a possible 236 regular-season games. The 6-foot-5 Doleman played two seasons for Atlanta and three seasons with San Francisco before returning to Minnesota to finish his career in 1999. “Chris was a great example for players past and present, as he embodied all the best characteristics of a Viking — resilience, toughness and a competitive spirit,” the Vikings said. “Chris always carried himself with dignity and class. Vikings fans worldwide will greatly miss him.” Hall of Fame president and CEO David Baker said witnessing Doleman’s baptism in the Jordan River during a Hall of Fame trip to Israel was “one of the honors” of his life. “The legacy of Chris Doleman will live forever in Canton, Ohio, for generations to learn from how he lived a life of courage and character,” Baker said. Former Vikings wide receiver Cris Carter, another fellow Hall of Famer, played with Doleman from 1990-93 and again in 1999. Carter joined Doleman for that Jordan River baptism. “Another great man gone,” Carter tweeted on Wednesday. “Today will be tough.” Kansas City coach Andy Reid, in Miami for preparations for the Super Bowl on Sunday, was tasked with trying to defend Doleman for years while working with Green Bay’s offensive line. “He was a phenomenal player,” Reid said. Chiefs linebacker Terrell Suggs, who is 11 1/2 sacks and three places behind Doleman on the all-time list, grew up in the Twin Cities rooting for the Vikings and told reporters at the Super Bowl on Wednesday that Doleman inspired him to wear No. 56 in youth football.

Allies worry as US ponders cutting military forces in Africa,https://apnews.com/53c70dbee943ac99dbac6d7b35b52fdd,2020-01-29,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — As extremist violence grows across Africa, the United States is considering reducing its military presence on the continent, a move that worries its international partners who are working to strengthen the fight in the tumultuous Sahel region. The timing is especially critical in the Sahel, the vast arid region south of the Sahara Desert, where militants with links to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have carried out increased attacks in the past six months. In Niger and Mali, soldiers have been ambushed and at times overpowered by hundreds of extremist gunmen on motorcycles. More than 500,000 people have been displaced by violence in Burkina Faso. The pending decision is part of a worldwide review by Defense Secretary Mark Esper, who is looking for ways to tighten the focus on China and Russia. “My aim is to free up time, money and manpower around the globe, where we currently are, so that I can direct it” toward Asia or return forces to the United States to improve combat readiness, Esper said Monday after meeting with French Defense Minister Florence Parly, who traveled to Washington to urge the U.S. not to reduce forces in the Sahel. High-profile Republicans and Democrats have warned that such a decision would undermine national security. They argue that cuts in Africa could hand over influence on the booming continent of 1.2 billion people to China and Russia. The commander of U.S. forces in Africa, Gen. Stephen Townsend, is scheduled to testify Thursday to the Senate Armed Services Committee about the role of American forces in Africa. Talk of a possible troop reduction “is reinforcing a view in West Africa that the U.S. is not interested, that it does not see it as a strategic importance and that it is going to cut and run and abandon its African allies,” Judd Devermont, director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies Africa Program, told The Associated Press. The U.S. has about 6,000 personnel on the continent. In West Africa, the Africa Command’s mandate is to advise and assist, whereas in East Africa, where most of the U.S. troops are located, forces also accompany African troops on missions. More than 1,000 U.S. personnel are currently in the Sahel. The U.S. has also constructed a $110 million drone base in northern Niger. Nigeria’s information minister, Lai Mohammed, urged the U.S. not to cut back, citing an increase in terrorism in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, Cameroon and Chad since the defeat of ISIS in Syria. “So I think what we need now is more support,” Mohammed told the AP. “I’m not talking in terms of physical soldiers, American soldiers. But I think we need more support. Otherwise we will inadvertently be strengthening the hand of the terrorists.” The looming U.S. decision comes as former colonizer France pledges more support than ever before to Sahel countries. France already has sent more than 200 additional troops to reinforce its already 4,500-strong operation in the Sahel, and French Chief of Staff François Lecointre says he will request even more troops. The mission in the Sahel “is a classic case of burden sharing, where limited U.S. support leverages an immense effort carried out by France and Europe,” Parly said, speaking alongside Esper on Monday at a Pentagon news conference. Parly joined top Portuguese, Swedish and Estonian military officials on a visit to Niger, Chad and Mali last week to discuss how to proceed with an international anti-terrorism coalition dubbed Takouba. At a summit with West African leaders this month, French President Emmanuel Macron said he hopes to convince U.S. President Donald Trump that the fight against global extremism “is also at stake in this region.” West African leaders at the summit said they hoped the U.S. would maintain its military presence in West Africa. The heads of state for the G5 Sahel, a group that includes Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Mauritania and Chad, asked for a continuation of American and French military engagement in the region and “pleaded for a strengthening of the international presence alongside them,” according to the closing statement for the summit. The U.S. footprint in West Africa, where the cuts would most likely happen, is light compared to other regions. But the effect of its force presence, training programs, development aid and military assistance is important, leaders say. Col. Thomas Geiser, deputy commander of special operations for the Africa Command, said the biggest risk is allowing al-Qaida affiliates and the Islamic State to expand “and potentially consolidate safe havens there.” He emphasized the need for a strengthened regional and multi-national approach to the violence and for more broad support of communities, saying African partners must lead efforts. But a regional security force assembled by the G5 Sahel has struggled to fund its efforts and end the violence. The G5 Sahel force will now focus most of its efforts in the tri-border region between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, targeting Islamic State Grand Sahara, Parly said. However, progress in the Sahel has been minimal, and the problems there need to be solved by those regional governments, the assistant secretary for the U.S. State Department’s African affairs division, Tibor Nagy, said Monday during a telephone press briefing. “The U.S. is actively involved through a number of programs in the Sahel region,” Nagy said. “It takes political will to counter terrorism.” It is unclear also how the newly constructed drone air base in northern Niger will be affected. Last week, the U.S. handed over a C-130 hangar at Niger Air Base 201 to the Nigerien Air Force. Col. Abdoul Kader Amirou, deputy chief of staff for the Nigerien Air Force, said the hangar will boost capabilities for the armed forces and “strengthen joint actions between the Nigerien and U.S. forces.” Associated Press writers Robert Burns in Washington, Andy Drake in London and Thomas Adamson in Paris contributed to this report.",Associated Press News,"“My aim is to free up time, money and manpower around the globe, where we currently are, so that I can direct it” toward Asia or return forces to the United States to improve combat readiness, Esper said Monday after meeting with French Defense Minister Florence Parly, who traveled to Washington to urge the U.S. not to reduce forces in the Sahel.

"Confined at home, Chinese get creative to beat boredom",https://apnews.com/bb8aba68717061e34c5fde2881693566,2020-01-29,"BANGKOK (AP) — Chinese around the country confined to their apartments either by choice or by order are making the best of the situation as cities remain in lockdown in a desperate bid to contain a new, dangerous virus. A couple from Shantou, a coastal city in Guangdong province, recreated a childhood game at home for their children. In video posted on Douyin, a popular Chinese social media platform, the mom pretends to be a street vendor selling hoops made of cardboard paper. The children throw the hoops to score prizes laid out on the ground. It is a popular game usually played outdoor at Chinese New Year celebrations, but this year is different. “Many travel plans and outdoor activities were canceled. A lot of people are strictly limiting their needs of going outside,” said Ouyang, the father. “Staying home is boring. So we decided to play this game at home with our kids and record a short clip of it.” A woman who goes by screen name Liang Jinjin lives in Yichang in Hubei province, a city not too far from the outbreak epicenter of Wuhan and one of several places where public transportation and traffic with the outside world have been blocked off. In her collection of videos, she sips water from a giant glass to her own reflection in the mirror and drinks from a coconut with a TV background showing animation of a beach. In another clip, she makes a tiny snowman with ice from her freezer. “During the outbreak, everyone is nervous and staying at home spontaneously. But staying home is very boring, so this video of me ‘traveling’ at home is to hope that everyone can face the epidemic with positivity and optimism,” she said. Schools around China have delayed the start of spring semester due to the outbreak. So university student Wei Zikai turned his living room into a badminton court. Others took to the social media to show off their skills like playing word games with Apple’s virtual assistant Siri, pretending to be fishing from a small bucket in their room, and playing billiard using chopsticks and cherry tomatoes and longan, a tropical fruit, for balls. On Monday night, residents of some Wuhan high-rise apartment buildings joined together, at least in spirit, from their balconies and windows to sing the national anthem and other songs. The anthem’s refrain, “Qilai, qilai, qilai!” or “Rise up, rise up, rise up!” echoed between the towers of skyscrapers in the city of 11 million, where streets have grown eerily quiet as families try to avoid contact with others who might be infected. Others shouted “Wuhan, fight!” echoing the chants heard from protesters in Hong Kong, where anti-government demonstrations have stretched on for months. The death toll from the virus has topped 100 and more than 4,500 have fallen ill. More than 50 million people in Wuhan and nearby cities are being kept in place in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed.",Associated Press News,"So we decided to play this game at home with our kids and record a short clip of it.” A woman who goes by screen name Liang Jinjin lives in Yichang in Hubei province, a city not too far from the outbreak epicenter of Wuhan and one of several places where public transportation and traffic with the outside world have been blocked off.

"Trump looks to sign trade deal, show wins during impeachment",https://apnews.com/e6ede49e1c07c7e928238c778fd792b5,2020-01-29,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump is eager to show off a big policy triumph during his impeachment trial by signing into law a major rewrite of the rules of trade with Canada and Mexico. Trump made renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement a priority during his 2016 campaign, although trade experts say the impact of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement will be modest. He planned to sign the bill Wednesday. Canada and Mexico already represent the top two export markets for U.S. goods. But the pact, along with the signing of a “phase one” agreement with China, dials down trade tensions that contributed to slowing economic growth globally. The leaders of the three nations signed the new pact in late 2018. Legislation implementing the North American deal received overwhelming, bipartisan support in Congress after several months of behind-the-scenes negotiations between Democratic lawmakers and the Trump administration. Still, it appeared that prominent Democratic lawmakers were left off the White House guest list for Wednesday’s event. The snub came after the Democratic-led House impeached Trump. “What the president will be signing is quite different from what the president sent us,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Wednesday. “We were able to make vast improvements. If we weren’t, we would not have been able to pass the bill.” Rep. Richard Neal, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said it only passed Congress because of how the Democrats forced changes in Trump’s original proposal. “They voted for it for one reason, is because of how we shaped and altered the president’s proposal,” said Neal, D-Mass. Trump has billed the agreement as a “a new model of trade for the 21st century.” Speaking to supporters at a New Jersey rally on Tuesday night, Trump said: “Tomorrow we will replace the NAFTA nightmare, one of the worst trade deals ever in history.” NAFTA, which took effect in 1994, tore down trade barriers between the three North American countries and commerce between them surged. But Trump and other critics said NAFTA encouraged factories to leave the United States and relocate south of the border to take advantage of low-wage Mexican labor. Trump threatened to leave NAFTA if he couldn’t get a better deal, creating uncertainty over regional trade. His trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, pressed for a revamped pact designed to bring factory jobs back to the United States. The new agreement, for example, requires automakers to get 75% of their production content (up from 62.5% in NAFTA) from within North America to qualify for the pact’s duty-free benefits. That means more auto content would have to come from North America, not imported more cheaply from China and elsewhere. At least 40% of vehicles would also have to originate in places where workers earn at least $16 an hour. That would benefit the United States and Canada — not Mexico, where auto assembly workers are paid a fraction of that amount. The independent U.S. International Trade Commission last year calculated that the U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal would add 0.35%, or $68 billion, to economic growth and generate 176,000 jobs over six years — not much of a change for a $22 trillion economy with 152 million nonfarm jobs. “It’s a blip,″ said Syracuse University economist Mary Lovely, who studies trade. “The main thing is what it isn’t: It isn’t a continuation of uncertainty, and it isn’t a major disruption″ to business. Critics include environmental groups concerned that the agreement does not address global warming. Some conservatives say the agreement will make cars and other products more expensive for consumers. The president wasn’t wasting any time highlighting the deal in battleground states that will determine who wins this year’s presidential election. He will travel Thursday to Michigan, where some of the state’s auto workers should benefit from a deal that encourages more manufacturing in the United States. Trump wants to talk up a deal that about 4 in 5 Americans have heard little or nothing about. Indeed, while a third of the public approves of the deal and only 5% disapprove, a solid majority, 61%, have not formed an opinion, according to a recent poll conducted by Monmouth University. Associated Press writer Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.",Associated Press News,"Trump made renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement a priority during his 2016 campaign, although trade experts say the impact of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement will be modest.

Leaked report shows United Nations suffered hack,https://apnews.com/0d958e15d7f5081dd612f07482f48b73,2020-01-29,"GENEVA (AP) — Sophisticated hackers infiltrated U.N. offices in Geneva and Vienna last year in an apparent espionage operation, and their identity and the extent of the data they obtained is not clear. An internal confidential document from the United Nations, leaked to The New Humanitarian and seen by the Associated Press, says dozens of servers were compromised including at the U.N. human rights office, which collects sensitive data and has often been a lightning rod of criticism from autocratic governments for exposing rights abuses. Asked about the report, one U.N. official told the AP that t he hack appeared  “sophisticated” and that the extent of the damage remained unclear, especially in terms of personal, secret or compromising information that may have been stolen. The official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity to speak freely about the episode, said systems have since been reinforced. The skill level was so high it was possible a state-backed actor might have been behind it, the official said. “It’s as if someone were walking in the sand, and swept up their tracks with a broom afterward,” the official said. “There’s not even a trace of a clean-up.” There were conflicting accounts, however, about the severity of the incursion. “We were hacked,” U.N. human rights office spokesman Rupert Colville. “We face daily attempts to get into our computer systems. This time, they managed, but it did not get very far. Nothing confidential was compromised.” Colville’s statement appeared to contradict the leaked September report, however. It says logs that would have betrayed the hackers’ activities inside the U.N. networks — what was accessed and what may have been siphoned out — were “cleared.” It also shows that among accounts known to have been accessed were those of domain administrators — who by default have master access to all user accounts in their purview. Jake Williams, CEO of t he cybersecurity firm Rendition Infosec and a former U.S. government hacker, sa id the fact that the hackers cleared the network logs indicates they were not top flight. The most skilled hackers - including U.S., Russian and Chinese agents —can  cover their tracks by editing those logs instead of wiping them clean. “The intrusion definitely looks like espionage,” said Williams, noting that the active directory component — where all users’ permissions are managed — from three different domains were compromised: those of United Nations offices in Geneva and Vienna and of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. “This, coupled with the relatively small number of infected machines, is highly suggestive of espionage,” he said after viewing the report. “The attackers have a goal in mind and are deploying malware to machines that they believe serve some purpose for them.” Any number of intelligence agencies from around the globe are likely interested in infiltrating the U.N., said Williams. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the attack “resulted in a compromise of core infrastructure components” and was “determined to be serious.” The earliest detected activity related to the intrusion occurred in July and it was detected in August, he in response to emailed questions. He said the world body does not have enough information to determine who might have been behind the incursion, but added “the methods and tools used in the attack indicate a high level of resource, capability and determination. “The damage related to this specific attack has been contained, and additional mitigation measures implemented,” Dujarric wrote. “Nevertheless the threat of future attacks continues, and the United Nations Secretariat detects and responds to multiple attacks of various level of sophistication on a daily basis.” The internal document from the U.N. Office of Information and Technology said 42 servers were “compromised” and another 25 were deemed “suspicious,” n early all at the sprawling Geneva and Vienna offices. Three of the “compromised” servers belonged to Human Rights agency, which is located across town from the main U.N. office in Geneva, and two were used by the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe. The report says a flaw in Microsoft’s SharePoint software was exploited by the hackers to infiltrate the networks but that the type of malware used was not known nor had technicians identified the command and control servers on the internet used to exfiltrate information. Security researcher Matt Suiche, a French entrepreneur based in Dubai  who founded the cybersecurity firm Comae Technologies , reviewed the report and said it appeared entry was gained through an anti-corruption tracker at the U.N. Office of Drugs and Crime. The report mentions a range of IP addresses in Romania that may have been used to stage the infiltration, and Williams said one has some neighbors with a history of hosting malware. Technicians at the United Nations office in Geneva, the world body’s European hub, on at least two occasions worked through weekends in recent months to isolate the local U.N. data center from the Internet, re-write passwords and ensure the systems were clean. Twenty machines had to be rebuilt, the report says. The hack comes amid rising concerns about computer or mobile phone vulnerabilities, both for large organizations like governments and the U.N. as well as for individuals and businesses. Last week, U.N. human rights experts asked the U.S. government to investigate a suspected Saudi hack that may have siphoned data from the personal smartphone of Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, in 2018. On Tuesday, the New York Times’s bureau chief in Beirut, Ben Hubbard, said technology researchers suspected an attempted intrusion into his phone around the same time. The United Nations, and its human rights office, is particularly sensitive, and could be a tempting target. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, and her predecessors have called out, denounced and criticized alleged war crimes, crimes against humanity and less severe rights violations and abuses in places as diverse as Syria and Saudi Arabia. Dozens of independent human rights experts who work with the U.N. human rights office have greater leeway - and fewer political and financial ties to the governments that fund the United Nations and make up its membership - to denounce alleged rights abuses. Ian Richards, president of the Staff Council at the United Nations, expressed said “There’s a a lot of our data that could have been hacked, and we don’t know what that data could be.” That includes, for example, staff in the office of the special envoy for Syria carrying out sensitive investigations and human rights staffers interviewing witnesses. How much should U.N. staff trust the information infrastructure the U.N. is providing them?” Richards asked. “Or should they stop putting their information elsewhere?” Bajak, an AP technology writer, reported from Boston.

Warren Buffett gets out of the newspaper business,https://apnews.com/a9dbfef3a94c94fe3ccb105f7fbda07f,2020-01-29,"OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Billionaire Warren Buffett is giving up on the newspaper business. Buffett is a lifelong fan of newspapers but he has said for several years that he expects most of them to continue on their declining trajectory, save for a handful of national papers such as The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The deal covers 31  daily newspapers in 10 states as well as 49 paid weekly publications with digital sites and 32 other print products. Other newspapers include the Tulsa World in Oklahoma and the Winston-Salem Journal in North Carolina. As part of the agreement, Lee will enter into a 10-year lease for BH Media’s real estate. Lee has been managing the BH Media publications since July 2018. “This is a compelling and transformative transaction for Lee,” said Mary Junck, Lee’s chairman. “It both refinances our long-term debt on attractive terms and provides new revenue opportunities as well as operational synergies across an expanded portfolio.” Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and CEO, said he and his partner, Charlie Munger, have long admired Lee. “We had zero interest in selling the group to anyone else for one simple reason: We believe that Lee is best positioned to manage through the industry’s challenges,” Buffett said. Newspapers make up a small part of Berkshire Hathaway, which owns an assortment of more than 90 companies and holds major investments in companies like Coca-Cola Co., Apple and Wells Fargo. Berkshire Hathaway is providing about $576 million in long-term, 9% financing to Lee, which it will use to pay for the Berkshire properties and refinance Lee’s approximately $400 million in existing debt. Berkshire will be Lee’s sole lender after the deal closes. Lee said it expects to eliminate about $20 million in annual costs as part of the deal primarily by cutting administrative expenses at the newspapers. Lee said it also expects to increase revenue by about $5 million by focusing on growing digital revenue and changes to subscription pricing. Lee’s portfolio will grow to 81 daily papers and nearly double its audience size, the company said. The deal is expected to close in mid-March.",Associated Press News,"“It both refinances our long-term debt on attractive terms and provides new revenue opportunities as well as operational synergies across an expanded portfolio.” Buffett, Berkshire’s chairman and CEO, said he and his partner, Charlie Munger, have long admired Lee.

The Latest: Jet evacuating Americans lands in California,https://apnews.com/748c0065d28cf67934ad7782573abff2,2020-01-29,"12:10 a.m. Thursday A plane evacuating 201 Americans from the Chinese city at the center of the virus outbreak has arrived in California. The jet landed Wednesday morning at March Air Reserve Base east of Los Angeles after all passengers passed health screenings during a refueling stop in Anchorage, Alaska. The passengers will undergo additional screenings in California and be placed in temporary housing. Officials have not said how long they will stay there. 11:45 p.m. An 80-year-old Chinese tourist is on artificial respiration in a Paris hospital with a new virus that is rapidly spreading, after two French hospitals initially declined to test him for the sickness. France has four confirmed cases of the deadly coronavirus, including two people in intensive care, and is seeking to repatriate hundreds of people from China. The 80-year-old arrived in France last Thursday and went to an emergency room in southern Paris on Saturday with a fever, said Dr. Yazdan Yazdanpanah, infectious diseases chief at Bichat Hospital. The man had a fever but no signs of respiratory trouble, and is not from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus, but about 400 kilometers (240 miles) north of there, Yazdanpanah told reporters Wednesday. Because he “didn’t fulfill the definition” of someone at risk of having the virus, two hospitals decided it was unnecessary to test him, Yazdanpanah said. “If we have to hospitalize all patients who have a fever and come from China, that’s dangerous for our hospital system in general,” he said. The tourist developed respiratory trouble on Wednesday, and tested positive for the virus. The hospitals held an emergency meeting to identify any personnel or patients who had been in touch with the man, who was put on artificial respiration and has a severe case of the virus, Yazdanpanah said. Bichat Hospital is leading French efforts to treat patients with the virus but hospital officials said it only has nine beds equipped for infected patients. 11 p.m. Germany’s Lufthansa and its subsidiaries Austrian Airlines and Swiss are suspending flights to mainland China through Feb. 9 as fears spread about a new virus that has killed more than 130 people. Lufthansa said in a statement Wednesday that the airlines will fly one last time to their destinations in China, giving passengers a chance to catch their flights and bringing crews back to Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The airlines will continue to fly to Hong Kong as scheduled. British Airways has also halted all flights to China and American Airlines has suspended flights to and from Shanghai and Beijing. They joined several Asian carriers that are either suspending or significantly cutting back service to China as fears spread about the coronavirus. Air India and South Korean budget carrier Seoul Air are also halting all flights to the country, and Indonesia’s Lion Air plans to do the same. Other carriers including Finnair, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific, and Singapore-based Jetstar Asia are slashing service. 8:30 p.m. Russian President Vladimir Putin has urged the country’s government to be prepared to deal with a possible outbreak of a new virus from China. “It is a new phenomenon, and the question is how well we are prepared for this challenge,” Putin said during a meeting with several Cabinet members. Russia shares a long border with China. Up to 2 million tourists from China visit Russia every year, with about the same number of Russian tourists traveling to China. So far there haven’t been any confirmed cases of the virus in Russia. Since the start of the outbreak of the coronavirus in China, officials have reported testing 1.3 million people who returned from China. More than 130 of them have been hospitalized with suspected coronavirus, but in the end were diagnosed with other conditions. 8 p.m. German auto parts maker Webasto said Wednesday it has temporarily shut its headquarters near Munich after four members of its staff were confirmed to have been infected with a new virus earlier this week. The infections are believed to have occurred following contact with a Chinese employee from Wuhan who had traveled to Germany to lead a training session. The company said most of the 1,000 staff at the site in Stockdorf are working from home for the time being. Webasto has an annual turnover of about 3.4 billion euros from the sale of panoramic car roofs and other auto parts, about half of which goes to China. 7:45 p.m. China has reported more infections from a new virus than it had from an outbreak of SARS in 2002-2003, although the death toll is still lower. China said it has confirmed 5,974 cases of the new virus, compared to 5,327 cases of SARS. It also reported another large jump in cases on Wednesday and a rise in the death toll to 132. That compares to 348 people killed in China during SARS. Severe acute respiratory syndrome killed nearly 800 people worldwide. Scientists say there are still many critical questions to be answered about the new virus, including just how transmissible and severe it is. More than 50 cases have been reported outside China. 7:30 p.m. The British government is preparing to fly citizens back from the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak of a new virus, and will put them in quarantine for two weeks. Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted Wednesday that “anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.” Britain’s Press Association news agency reported that the returning Britons will likely be held on a military base. There are an estimated 200 British citizens in Wuhan, and a flight is expected to bring them home on Thursday. At least 132 people have died and more than 6,000 have been infected with a new type of coronavirus that appeared in Wuhan in December. The British government has advised against all but essential travel to mainland China, and British Airways on Wednesday said it is suspending flights to and from the country, apart from Hong Kong. 7 p.m. Kazakhstan has suspended all flights, train and bus services to neighboring China and stopped issuing visas to Chinese nationals due to the outbreak of a new virus. The government announced halting all flights to China starting Monday and all trains as of Saturday. Passenger bus service was suspended earlier Wednesday. Kazakhstan, a vast nation in Central Asia, shares a long border with China. Kazakh authorities have also rejected a proposal by the International Tennis Federation to move a series of the Federation Cup games to Kazakhstan from China. Thirty-five people who recently traveled to China remain hospitalized in Kazakhstan, but none has been confirmed to be suffering from coronavirus. 6:15 p.m. Four members of a Chinese family who traveled to the United Arab Emirates are being treated for a new virus. The statement from health officials, carried by the state-run WAM news agency, comes after authorities earlier acknowledged the first cases Wednesday in the country that’s home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Earlier, it said the family came from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. It did not explain how or when the family traveled from Wuhan to the UAE, the home of long-haul carriers Emirates and Etihad Airways. 5 p.m. Australian health officials say the Chinese women’s national soccer team is being quarantined in Brisbane city over concerns about the possible spread of a new virus. Queensland state Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young says 32 people — including players and staff — traveled through the virus-effect Chinese city of Wuhan a week ago. The team will be kept in isolation in a Brisbane hotel until Wednesday next week. The group arrived in Brisbane on a flight from Shanghai on Tuesday before border officials placed them in isolation. They are travelling with a team doctor and none has shown symptoms. 4:15 p.m. British Airways says it’s immediately suspending all of its flights to and from mainland China after the U.K. government warned against unnecessary travel to the country amid a virus outbreak. BA said in a statement Wednesday that “we apologize to customers for the inconvenience, but the safety of our customers and crew is always our priority.” The airline operates daily flights from London’s Heathrow Airport to Shanghai and Beijing. It took the measure a day after Britain’s Foreign Office updated its travel advice on China, warning against “all but essential travel” to the mainland, not including Hong Kong and Macao. China has cut off access to Wuhan and 16 other cities to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further. The outbreak has killed more than 130 people. 11: 15 a.m. Australia and New Zealand will work together to evacuate their isolated and vulnerable citizens from China’s virus-hit Hubei province. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday could not say how many or how soon citizens would be flown by Qantas from Hubei. The departures would be arranged in consultation with China. The citizens would be sent for 14 days to a quarantine center on Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean which has been used to hold asylum seekers and foreign criminals facing deportation. Australia and New Zealand have also ratcheted up their travel advice for China. Australia has advised its citizens to reconsider their need to travel to China and not to travel to Hubei. New Zealand’s government advised people to avoid all non-essential travel to China due to the coronavirus outbreak. 10 a.m. Two Japanese men evacuated from a virus-hit Chinese city say they felt relieved but also exhausted upon their arrival in Tokyo. They were aboard a chartered flight Japan arranged to evacuate 206 Japanese citizens from Wuhan. Takeo Aoyama who works for Nippon Steel Corp. and Takayuki Kato, who works for Intec, both wore masks but said they felt fine. Kato said he was not panicking in Wuhan, but “I was shocked when all transportation systems were suspended. That’s when the situation drastically changed.” China cut off access to Wuhan and 16 other cities to try to contain the outbreak of the new type of coronavirus that has infected thousands of people. Aoyama said many people who wish to go home to Japan are still in Wuhan, including workers at a Japanese supermarket chain staying open to supply food. He said it is important to step up preventive measures in Japan, but “I hope we can also provide support for the Chinese people, which I think would also help the Japanese people who are still there.”",Associated Press News,"The British government is preparing to fly citizens back from the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak of a new virus, and will put them in quarantine for two weeks.

Pastor’s fight against KKK becomes movie that may aid battle,https://apnews.com/6070e0d47a9b510d173ce33b867dee9c,2020-01-29,"LAURENS, S.C. (AP) — Not many years ago in a small, rural South Carolina town stood The Redneck Shop — a racist emporium and Ku Klux Klan museum housed in an old theater, where white supremacist neo-Nazis gave heil-Hitler salutes and flaunted swastikas and Rebel flags. That building, once the property of the Klan, now belongs to a black preacher and committed foe of racism who fought the group for more than 20 years. The Rev. David Kennedy plans to transform it into a shrine of reconciliation. How Kennedy, whose great-great-uncle was lynched in the community, got ownership of the old Echo Theater building from an ex-Klansman — a man who once contemplated murdering Kennedy — is the subject of a movie that could end up raising funds for that transformation. “It symbolizes right now in the shape it’s in — hatred,” Kennedy said. “But we hope we can turn it into a building of love.” A decade ago, the white supremacist store in Laurens was a place where one of the few shirts sold without an overt racial slur said,  “If I had known this was going to happen I would have picked my own cotton.”  The World Famous Ku Klux Klan Museum with its racist meeting place was in the back. The KKK had put the title in the name of a trusted member, Michael Burden. Burden says other Klan members once suggested that he kill Kennedy, and he considered it. Kennedy didn’t know that when he saw Burden, hungry, poor and full of hate, and took him to a buffet to fill his stomach, then to a hotel so his family wouldn’t have to sleep on the street. Burden’s girlfriend at the time kept urging him to leave the Klan and in 1997, he did. He also bestowed ownership of the old theater building upon Kennedy for $1,000. But there was a twist. Under the agreement, John Howard, who owned The Redneck Shop, would be allowed to stay and run his store as long as he lived. Howard abandoned the store years ago, ignoring maintenance. Duct work and piping were ripped from the walls. He died in 2017, giving Kennedy complete control over the building. Kennedy estimates it needs at least $500,000 in repairs that must be done carefully because of the theater’s age and historic location. That seems impossible for the minister whose New Beginning Missionary Baptist Church congregation meets in a converted gun store several miles west of Laurens. But a movie may provide a Hollywood ending. The story of the unlikely friendship between Kennedy and Burden has been made into a film called “Burden,” scheduled for national release Feb. 28. Starring actor Forest Whitaker as Kennedy, it was shown at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival. 101 Studios, which distributed it, has promised Kennedy it’ll help repair and reopen the theater. “The South cannot rid itself of its past. But we could rid ourselves of the Redneck Shop,” Kennedy said. The studio is getting companies to donate materials and time and is selling commemorative bricks that can be placed  at the theater. The movie’s director, Andrew Heckler, first entered The Redneck Shop in the late 1990s after reading a short article about Kennedy’s fight. He knew it had to be a movie and finished the screenplay in 2001, finally getting the green light from 101 Studios to make the film a few years ago. “I knew this story would mean something to people. Three people in the middle of nowhere South Carolina did something that would be meaningful to all people,” Heckler said. “There is a pathway for fighting hate. It’s not easy. It’s love, faith and not giving up.” Kennedy knows about not giving up. He protested when a South Carolina county refused to observe the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, and he helped lobby to remove the Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome. In his church office, he keeps a poster-size photo of a lynched black man swinging at the end of a rope. It is his great uncle, killed more than 100 years ago by a white mob in Laurens County. Kennedy also has a photo of white people about 15 years ago in the back of the theater, wearing uniforms with a Nazi swastika and raising their arms and hands in a white power salute. “Racism is a strange kind of organism. It is systemic. And it probably will not go away in our lifetimes,” Kennedy said. Burden and Kennedy remain friends, though not as close as they once were. Burden got married, turned his life around and now drives a truck across the country. “When I changed my lifestyle I buried that guy,” Burden said of his racist past. Burden cautiously shares his story with those he thinks need to know that change is possible. The movie named after him is a way to do that on a larger scale. “I’m willing to go through this again,” Burden said. “Am I happy about it? Some days yes, some days no.” Kennedy recently gave a tour of the theater to a few visiting reporters. Through the soft winter afternoon sunlight, faded two-story paintings of Nazi and U.S. flags can still be seen on a wall. A Confederate flag remains on the theater marquee. The images are deteriorating, but they linger. “Racism and hatred, they are both destructive and they have no future,” Kennedy said. “But love, forgiveness and mercy will always have a future because they are constructive.” ___ Follow Jeffrey Collins on Twitter at https://twitter.com/JSCollinsAP",Associated Press News,"How Kennedy, whose great-great-uncle was lynched in the community, got ownership of the old Echo Theater building from an ex-Klansman — a man who once contemplated murdering Kennedy — is the subject of a movie that could end up raising funds for that transformation. “But we hope we can turn it into a building of love.” A decade ago, the white supremacist store in Laurens was a place where one of the few shirts sold without an overt racial slur said,  “If I had known this was going to happen I would have picked my own cotton.”  The World Famous Ku Klux Klan Museum with its racist meeting place was in the back. “I knew this story would mean something to people."
No. 1 Nadal upset by Thiem in Australian Open quarterfinals,https://apnews.com/bf89b39ec34c6e7430f8032db55ba258,2020-01-29,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Outplayed at his own brand of physical tennis for much of the match, Rafael Nadal finally claimed a set to try to start a comeback against Dominic Thiem. Nadal marked the moment by hopping in a crouch at the baseline and vigorously pumping his right arm four times. Soon, though, he was back in trouble. And eventually, his bid to tie Roger Federer’s record of 20 Grand Slam titles by winning the Australian Open was over with a quarterfinal loss Wednesday to Thiem — a younger version of Nadal himself. Thiem’s 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4), 4-6, 7-6 (6) victory over the top-seeded Nadal lasted 4 hours, 10 minutes because of so many lengthy, electrifying points. One rather memorable one featured Thiem stumbling onto his backside before popping up and keeping the ball in play until Nadal made a mistake. “He’s playing with a lot of energy ... (and) determination. So well done for him,” Nadal said. “I honestly didn’t play a bad match.” Thiem reached his fifth major semifinal but first somewhere other than at the French Open, the place that is Nadal’s domain. Of more significance: The outcome ended Nadal’s career-best streak of making at least the semifinals at seven consecutive Grand Slam tournaments, a span during which he earned three trophies. “If you want to have a chance against him, one of the all-time greats, everything needs to work in your game,” the fifth-seeded Thiem said. The last time Nadal didn’t get to the final four at a major? Also at the Australian Open, where he also went out in the quarterfinals two years ago before finishing as the runner-up to Novak Djokovic in 2019. That was Nadal’s fourth defeat in a final at Melbourne Park since he won his lone title at the place in 2009. He’s won two at Wimbledon, four at the U.S. Open and 12 at the French Open. Asked what he wished he’d done differently against Thiem, Nadal replied: “Win any tiebreak.” Thiem had been 0-5 against Nadal at the majors, including losses in the final at Roland Garros each of the past two years. But this one was different. The defining statistic: Thiem won exactly twice as many points that featured nine or more shots, 24-12. “Just an unbelievable match. Like, epic,” Thiem said. “A very high level from both of us.” Thiem managed to hang in there with Nadal on physical baseline exchanges, trading groundstroke for groundstroke and picking the proper spots to move forward. Or to describe it another way: Thiem was out-Nadal-ing Nadal, the ultimate grinder who never met a point that was too long or too grueling. “Even from difficult positions,” Nadal said, praising Thiem’s quickness and power, “he was able to produce amazing shots.” Now Thiem will play No. 7 Alexander Zverev on Friday for a berth in the title match. Zverev reached his first major semifinal anywhere by overcoming a terrible start Wednesday and putting together a 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 victory over three-time Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka. So instead of Nadal, 33, against Wawrinka, 34, it’ll be Zverev, 22, against Thiem, 26, a couple of members of the new generation trying to collect a breakthrough Slam title. “I think it’s the first time I am playing a Grand Slam semifinal and I am the older player,” Thiem said with a chuckle. The first two sets Wednesday sets were remarkably similar: Nadal would go up by a break, then Thiem would break back and take it in a tiebreaker. The first lasted 67 minutes, the second 69. Nadal was flustered by a warning from chair umpire Aurelie Tourte for a time violation, citing him for taking more than the allotted 25 seconds before serving. Nadal termed the call “amazing,” complaining that the previous point was comprised of an exhausting 19 shots and so the clock shouldn’t have started when it did (something which is at the chair umpire’s discretion). “You don’t like the good tennis,” he told Tourte. “You don’t like the good tennis.” Later, he gave Tourte a sarcastic thumb’s up after she told him he hesitated too long before trying to challenge a line call. Thiem’s biggest hiccups came as the end was near. There was the break that ceded the third set, the one celebrated so enthusiastically by Nadal. There was another break when Thiem served for the victory at 5-4 in the fourth but was undone by a series of jitters-induced mistakes. There were three off-the-mark forehands, with a double-fault mixed in for good measure. “Such a really mentally tough situation,” Thiem said. “Couldn’t handle it.” Then, on his first match point, at 6-4 in the last tiebreaker, Thiem drove a leaping forehand into the net, then covered his face with his left hand. His second match point came and went with a lob that landed long. But Thiem did not fold there, getting a third opportunity to close it with a cross-court backhand that glanced off the tape — one of a handful of favorable net cords for him. When Nadal missed one last forehand, Thiem looked to the sky and spread his arms wide.

Israeli president: Germany must win anti-Semitism fight,https://apnews.com/b4405d0fa6659e40ad24eb8065ca68c4,2020-01-29,"BERLIN (AP) — Lamenting rising anti-Semitism in Europe, Israel’s president said Germany “must not fail” in fighting it as he addressed German lawmakers Wednesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Auschwitz death camp’s liberation. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin’s address to parliament capped a three-day visit to Germany that started when he flew to Berlin from anniversary events at the Auschwitz site on Monday with German counterpart Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Rivlin, who recalled protesting when West Germany sent its first ambassador to Israel  in 1965,  praised today’s Germany as “a beacon for democracy, for liberalism, for responsibility and moderate forces.” He said that gives Germany “enormous” responsibility at a time when there are “other trends” in Europe and elsewhere. “Today, Europe is being haunted by the ghosts of the past — racial purity, nationalism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism,” said Rivlin, who spoke through an interpreter. “Ugly and extreme anti-Semitism is wafting over all of Europe, from the far-right to extreme left-wingers.” “It is important to me to bear in mind that we are certainly not in the 1930s — we are not on the threshold of a new Shoah, and we are not even close to that,” he said. But, he said, the stirring of anti-Semitism and xenophobia must not be ignored. Rising concern in Germany about anti-Semitism was intensified by an incident in October in which a man tried to force his way into a synagogue in Halle on Judaism’s holiest day, then killed two passers-by before being arrested. The suspect posted an anti-Jewish screed before the attack. On Sunday, Germany’s foreign minister called for stepped-up efforts to ward off the possibility that many Jews could decide to leave the country. Rivlin said the fight against anti-Semitism must be fought “persistently, generation for generation.” “We must not give up,” he said. “We must not ease off. Germany must not fail here.” Germany “has taken responsibility for the protection of international liberal values,” Rivlin added. “If this attempt fails in Germany ... it will be condemned to fail everywhere.” In his speech, Rivlin also acknowledged differences over Iran. Germany is one of the countries trying to keep alive Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers that the U.S. abandoned in 2018. “Such a regime is a risk to world peace,” he said. “There is only possibility: we must isolate this regime.” Rivlin also addressed the newly released U.S. plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has already been rejected by the Palestinians. He said both sides must examine the plan carefully and he hopes it will be implemented. “We must not give up,” he said.",Associated Press News,"On Sunday, Germany’s foreign minister called for stepped-up efforts to ward off the possibility that many Jews could decide to leave the country.

"Rapper Missy Elliott, H.E.R. team up for Pepsi Super Bowl ad",https://apnews.com/e7fed3b2c22de35823a26fc463086a6e,2020-01-29,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — Almost three years ago, Missy Elliott sent a tweet to a then under-the-radar artist whose music she admired and told her that “she was going to blow up.” Fast forward to this week and H.E.R. has been nominated for 10 Grammys, won two and is now starring with the rap legend in a new Pepsi commercial that will debut for the Super Bowl. “When Pepsi reached out and said we want to have you on the Super Bowl commercial and the other person would be H.E.R. I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is major’” Elliott said. Elliott first heard of the “Best Part” singer from a friend who had her debut album on repeat. Elliott thought the record was “hot” and “immediately started Googling her,” but couldn’t find much information beyond her mixtape. “It made me fall in love with her music,” Elliott told The Associated Press in a recent phone interview. “I didn’t get into what she looked like, what she said, what she had on, it was just the lyrics and the tracks and all that and I was like, ‘This girl is really talented’.” Now the pair are collaborating on a cover of the Rolling Stones’ classic “Paint it Black” for the commercial. The animated ad features H.E.R’s sultry sound awash in red, surrounded by fluid dancers swishing long, red trains before it melds into a black stage punctuated by an upbeat rap from Elliott. The new track was co-produced by Elliott and longtime collaborator Timbaland with original lyrics from both artists and guitar and vocals from H.E.R. “It’s scary when you’re having to recreate something that is so iconic and make sure that you do it justice,” said Elliott, who performed at the Super Bowl with Katy Perry in 2015. The two are the latest to join Pepsi’s ad lineup, joining the ranks of Ray Charles, Michael Jackson, Tina Turner and Britney Spears. They bonded in the studio, where H.E.R. said they got to know each other on a more personal level. “She was telling me tour stories ... I felt like I had the inside scoop. It was really cool to peek into her world,” said H.E.R. “She’s just dope musically…there’s nobody like Missy.” She added she’s always admired Elliott’s individuality and creativity as a producer. “Missy’s vibe is what I really loved and looked up to growing up, just how different she dared to be.” H.E.R. is still recovering from her whirlwind Grammy weekend: She performed on the telecast and was nominated for five Grammys, including record, song and album of the year. And Elliott is, um well, a little afraid to come to Miami even though she owns two houses here. “Last time I was there I went to open the door and a gecko lizard jumped on my shoulder and I swore I’d never come back. I was so scared ... those little gecko lizards are everywhere.”",Associated Press News,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla.

Russia rescues 536 fishermen stranded on giant ice floe ,https://apnews.com/6eda209aea5dafaef96f303a82ba92c6,2020-01-29,"MOSCOW (AP) — In a nearly seven-hour operation, Russia’s emergency services rescued 536 ice fishermen after they got stranded on a giant ice floe that broke off the island of Sakhalin in eastern Siberia, officials said. Around 60 more people were able to get back onto the shore on their own Tuesday evening, emergency officials said. Footage of the incident showed groups of people using smaller pieces of ice as rafts and trying to row to the Russian coast on them as the giant ice floe with the stranded fishermen slowly drifted further away from the land. According to some of the Russian fishermen, by the time they had been rescued the frigid water rift between the ice floe and the coast was already 200 meters (660 feet) wide. It’s the third time in a week that emergency services in the Sakhalin region had to rescue ice fishermen stuck on drifting glacial masses.

Antiques Roadshow guest floored by value of old Rolex watch,https://apnews.com/27089c9f733566b18f51f62cbce69267,2020-01-29,"WEST FARGO, N.D. (AP) — An “Antiques Roadshow” guest in North Dakota was floored when he found out the current value of a Rolex watch he purchased while serving in the military more than four decades ago. The man, identified only as David on an episode that aired Monday, said he paid $345.97 for the watch in 1974 while serving in the Air Force. He said he planned to use the watch to scuba dive, but decided it was too nice for the water and tucked it away in a safe deposit box until he brought it to a show taping in West Fargo. Appraiser Peter Planes told David the watch was similar to one once worn by Paul Newman that auctions for $200,000. And because it had the tiny word “Oyster” inscribed on the face that made it “extremely, extremely rare,” which could double the value. David toppled to the ground when he learned the watch could sell for $400,000. When he regained his footing, Planes told him that because the watch was in pristine condition it could fetch up to $700,000 — a price that caused David to utter a word that was bleeped from the show.",Associated Press News,"He said he planned to use the watch to scuba dive, but decided it was too nice for the water and tucked it away in a safe deposit box until he brought it to a show taping in West Fargo.

Japanese evacuation flight brings back workers from Wuhan,https://apnews.com/a9b9ee41f8f11157b10e672ae9fd7759,2020-01-29,"TOKYO (AP) — The first group of Japanese evacuees from a virus-hit Chinese city arrived in Tokyo on Wednesday, a dozen of them with cough and fever including two who were later diagnosed with pneumonia. Five of the 206 evacuees were taken to designated Tokyo hospitals specializing in treating infectious diseases, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told a parliamentary session, adding that they were still checking if any passengers were ill with the virus. Two who had pneumonia were not yet linked to the new coronavirus, Tokyo city officials said. All five patients, being treated at two Tokyo hospitals, were stable, hospital officials said. Later Wednesday, seven other evacuees who cleared an earlier screening on board were also found to have coughs and fever in a secondary screening and were hospitalized, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said in a statement. The remaining evacuees who had no symptoms were taken to a hotel where they will be quarantined. Japan’s government sent a chartered flight to pick up the evacuees, most of whom resided close to the Wuhan seafood market linked to the first cases of the new virus that has infected thousands. “We were feeling increasingly uneasy as the situation developed so rapidly when we were still in the city,” Takeo Aoyama, an employee at Nippon Steel Corp.’s subsidiary in Wuhan, told reporters at Tokyo’s Haneda airport while he waited for a bus to take him to a hospital for another health check. “My uneasiness peaked when the number of patients started to spike,” he said, wearing a mask that muffled his voice. “I fell asleep as soon as I sat down on my seat (on the plane),” he said. Other evacuees seated near him also seemed relieved but tired. Japan has eight confirmed cases, including what could be the country’s first human-to-human infections, a tour bus driver who served two groups of Chinese tourists from Wuhan on Jan. 8-16, and a tour guide who worked on the same bus. Officials said about 650 Japanese citizens and their families in Wuhan and elsewhere in Hebei province had sought to return home. Aoyama said there are more than 400 others still in Wuhan, including those working for a Japanese supermarket chain that has stayed open to serve customers who need food and other necessities and supplies. He said it was important to step up preventive measures in Japan, but “I hope we can also provide support for the Chinese people, while we also help Japanese people who are still there.” Another evacuee, Takayuki Kato, said that all those wishing to leave Wuhan had submitted their health inquiry form and had their temperature taken before departure. While on board, a doctor came to each passenger to take temperature again and check their condition, he said. Kato said he did not panic as he was able to monitor news online and via local media, but “I was shocked when all transportation systems were suspended. That’s when the situation drastically changed.” Aoyama and Kato, along with the rest of the evacuees who were not showing immediate signs of infection, were expected to be taken to the National Center for Global Health and Medicine for further checks and a virus test. Health officials said that evacuees will be sent home on chartered buses to keep them from using public transportation and stay home for about two weeks until their virus test results are out, though it’s not legally binding. Others who need to travel long distance home are asked to stay at designated hotels. Abe’s Cabinet designated the new coronavirus as an infectious disease Tuesday, allowing hospitalization and treatment of the patients compulsory, but the measure is taking effect Feb. 7 because of the required 10-day notification period, causing concerns that it may be too late. Former Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told a ruling party meeting that “if you abide by law and people die, it’s useless,” Kyodo News quoted him as saying. Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told the parliamentary session Wednesday that the government would have to send two more flights to evacuate the rest of the people wishing to return home. Japan’s government said it will send another chartered flight to evacuate the others later Wednesday. Associated Press journalist Haruka Nuga contributed to this report.

 Critics: Critical bank law is softened under Trump proposal,https://apnews.com/573076b526111294473790d72e851334,2020-01-29,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Community Reinvestment Act has over the past four decades spurred hundreds of billions of dollars in lending to low- and middle-income communities. But it’s out of date and in need of an overhaul. Now, the Trump administration is proposing changes that some community advocates say will make it easier for banks to meet the law’s criteria without making the types of loans that are most beneficial to the communities they serve. The CRA’s current regulations reward banks that make mortgages and small business loans in their communities. Under the administration’s new proposal, banks could get credit for other types of lending to low-income customers like credit cards and personal loans — a move that would greatly benefit the largest of the country’s banks because they already dominate these lines of business. The regulations would also give banks credit, under certain circumstances, for loans they make to build or improve facilities such as sports stadiums and hospitals. It’s the broadening of what would qualify under CRA that has community groups upset. Democrats are likely to express some of those concerns when the regulator overseeing the changes to the Community Reinvestment Act appears before Congress. Joseph Otting, the Comptroller of the Currency, will testify before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday, beginning at 10 a.m. Sweet reported from New York.",Associated Press News,"Under the administration’s new proposal, banks could get credit for other types of lending to low-income customers like credit cards and personal loans — a move that would greatly benefit the largest of the country’s banks because they already dominate these lines of business.

EU to repatriate 600 citizens seeking to flee China virus,https://apnews.com/83a02f4382ad13bea2bf7e0e6bfff0bb,2020-01-29,"BRUSSELS (AP) — The European Union is working to repatriate about 600 citizens from 14 EU countries seeking to leave China because of a spreading new virus that has already killed more than 130 people. European Crisis Management Commissioner Janez Lenarcic told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday that the situation with the deadly virus centered on the Chinese city of Wuhan “is likely to get worse before it will get better.” He said the EU has offered help to China to deal with the virus and can mobilize emergency financing and medical teams if needed. “We are actively coordinating” with Chinese authorities to repatriate citizens from Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Britain, he said. He said the organization of the flights was still under way and couldn’t give details on when the evacuation flights would leave or what destinations they would involve. The United States and Japan have already evacuated some citizens from the affected area in China. Chinese officials said Wednesday the death toll from the virus rose to 132, with confirmed infections jumping to 5,974 cases. Scientists say there are still many questions to be answered about the new virus, including just how transmissible and severe it is. In China’s Hubei province, 17 cities including Wuhan have been locked down, trapping more than 50 million people in the most far-reaching disease control measures ever imposed. The EU administration urged all of its staff to postpone any non-essential travel to China. The EU is also planning a meeting of health ministers from all 28 members to discuss the virus outbreak. “We mustn’t underestimate the situation. We need to mobilize all our tools,” said European Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides. The British government said it’s preparing to fly U.K. citizens back from the Chinese city at the center of the outbreak and will put them in quarantine for two weeks. British Health Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted Wednesday “anyone who returns from Wuhan will be safely isolated for 14 days, with all necessary medical attention.” There’s an estimated 200 U.K citizens in Wuhan, and a flight is expected to bring them back to the U.K. on Thursday. Britain’s Press Association news agency reported the returning Britons will likely be held on a military base. British Airways said Wednesday it is halting all flights to China, joining several Asian carriers that are either suspending or significantly cutting back service there due to fears of spreading the virus and endangering employees’ health. The airline operates daily flights from London’s Heathrow Airport to Shanghai and Beijing. It took the measure a day after Britain’s Foreign Office warned against “all but essential travel” to the Chinese mainland, not including Hong Kong and Macao. Germany’s Lufthansa and its subsidiaries Austrian Airlines and Swiss announced they are suspending flights to mainland China through Feb. 9. Lufthansa said Wednesday the airlines will fly one last time to their destinations in China, giving passengers a chance to catch their flights and bring crews back to Germany, Switzerland and Austria. The airlines will continue to fly to Hong Kong. German auto parts maker Webasto said Wednesday it has temporarily shut its headquarters near Munich after four employees were confirmed to have been infected with the new virus earlier this week. The infections are believed to have occurred following contact with a Chinese employee from Wuhan who had traveled to Germany to lead a training session. The company said most of the 1,000 staff at the site in Stockdorf are working from home for the time being. Webasto sells panoramic car roofs, heating and other auto parts, about half of which go to China. Russian President Vladimir Putin urged the government to “be prepared” for dealing with a possible outbreak of the new virus, even though Russia has not had a single confirmed case so far. Russia shares a long border with China and up to 2 million Chinese tourists visit Russia every year. “It is a new phenomenon, and the question is how well we are prepared for this challenge,” Putin said Wednesday during a meeting with Cabinet members. In sports, the Danish top-tier soccer club Aalborg Boldklub decided not to play a friendly against the Wuhan Zall club from the top Chinese league. They had been planning to meet up in Spain.

"737 Max costs double, Boeing posts first loss in 2 decades",https://apnews.com/8ea6d7147585b3799380bb7d14f5c504,2020-01-29,"Boeing, an icon in American manufacturing, suffered its first annual financial loss in more than two decades as the costs related to its marquee aircraft doubled to more than $18 billion after a pair of deadly crashes. New CEO David Calhoun on Wednesday stood by his estimate that regulators will certify changes Boeing is making to the 737 Max by mid-year. And he criticized the company’s prior leadership for not immediately disclosing a trove of damning internal communications. Boeing reported a loss of $1 billion in the fourth quarter as revenue plunged 37% due to the grounding of the Max. The company suspended deliveries of the plane last spring and never expected the stoppage to last this long. The company lost $636 million for all 2019. Boeing added another $9.2 billion to charges for concessions to airlines that have canceled thousands of Max flights and higher costs related to compensation, doubling its estimate of the total financial hit from the crisis to $18.6 billion. Revenue tumbled to $17.91 billion, far below Wall Street’s forecast of $21.70 billion, according to a FactSet survey of analysts. For all the troubling news from the company, Wall Street was happy that it wasn’t worse. Shares rose Shares of Boeing rose 3% to $326.39 at Wednesday’s opening bell. The Max was grounded last March, after two crashes within five months killed 346 people in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The crisis torpedoed sales and deliveries of new jetliners, leaving Boeing far behind rival Airbus. It caused a shutdown in Max production, layoffs at suppliers, and led to the firing of CEO Dennis Muilenburg. U.S. airlines that own Maxes – Southwest, American and United – don’t expect it back until after the peak of the summer travel season. It is anyone’s guess about how willing passengers will be to fly on the plane. The head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Stephen Dickson, told U.S. airline officials late last week that he was content with Boeing’s progress toward getting the Max back in the year, raising the possibility that the plane could fly sooner than Boeing has estimated. Calhoun said Wednesday he appreciated Dickson’s comments, but they wouldn’t cause him to change Boeing’s projection of regulatory approval by midyear because “if he changes those comments in a month, we change our schedule.” Calhoun said on CNBC that the Max is “a fundamentally sound airplane” that will be proven safe after undergoing exhaustive tests and scrutiny by the FAA. Boeing has been embarrassed in recent weeks by the disclosure of years-old internal messages in which test pilots and other key employees raised safety concerns about the Max — even saying they wouldn’t put their families on it — while the plane was in development and testing. Calhoun called the messages “horrible” and criticized company leaders who didn’t disclose the messages right away. He said board members were kept in the dark. “Every one of us involved in every step of that process believes we found out too late,” he said. “Were we as transparent as we needed to be when we did find out? No.” Calhoun and other Boeing executives were scheduled to discuss the fourth-quarter results with analysts later Wednesday. It will be the first earnings call for Calhoun, a former General Electric and Nielsen executive who had been on Boeing’s board since 2009.",Associated Press News,"The head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Stephen Dickson, told U.S. airline officials late last week that he was content with Boeing’s progress toward getting the Max back in the year, raising the possibility that the plane could fly sooner than Boeing has estimated.

“Eurydice” heads to LA Opera and then Met,https://apnews.com/076f6b61361cc358643bb776c820ebea,2020-01-29,"NEW YORK (AP) — More than 70 composers from Monteverdi to Glass have written operas inspired by the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, but that didn’t deter Matthew Aucoin from adding his name to the list. “I think musicians love the idea that music can bring people back from the dead,” Aucoin said. The 29-year-old composer’s “Eurydice” will have its world premiere at the Los Angeles Opera in February and then move to the Metropolitan Opera in the fall of 2021. The libretto by Sarah Ruhl is adapted from her play of the same name, which recasts the story of the musician’s descent to the underworld by focusing on his wife. Aucoin first explored the subject in a 2014 piece for countertenor, violin and orchestra called “The Orphic Moment.” He described that work as “a 17-minute explosion … kind of an expansion of the few milliseconds before Orpheus turns round” and thus loses his chance to bring Eurydice back to life. “It’s a very dark take on what’s in his mind,” Aucoin said in a joint interview with Ruhl following a rehearsal last month. “But I was so energized by writing the piece that I knew I wanted to return to it.” Aucoin has a dizzying resume for one so young: A graduate of Harvard University and The Juilliard School, he has served as an assistant conductor at the Met, as an apprentice to Riccardo Muti at the Chicago Symphony and is currently the first-ever artist in residence at the Los Angeles Opera. When the Met commissioned him to write an opera as part of the company’s new works initiative with Lincoln Center Theater, he began searching for the right project. Both his sister and Andre Bishop, artistic director of LCT, recommended Ruhl’s play, and Aucoin said: “I read it. And wept. And gave her a call.” Ruhl, who has a long list of plays to her credit but had never worked on an opera, noted that when they began their collaboration, Aucoin was 25, the same age she had been when she wrote “Eurydice.” “The genius and bravery of youth is undaunted,” she said. “It’s a good moment to start a crazily ambitious project because you just plunge in feet first.” Crazily ambitious or not, the result won an enthusiastic thumbs-up from Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, when he heard it at a piano workshop in 2018. “I thought it was fabulous,” Gelb said in an interview. “Matt is an original voice who’s writing music that is moving and beautiful.” Christopher Koelsch, president and CEO of the Los Angeles Opera, which signed on as co-commissioner early in the opera’s development, was already a fan of Aucoin’s because of his first opera, “Crossing,” based on diaries kept by the poet Walt Whitman while he tended to wounded Civil War soldiers. With “Eurydice,” he said, “the part that came as a surprise to me and a delight was a level of lightness and insouciance in the music.” Ruhl said adapting her play involved “a process of distillation, refinement, cutting and the little opera things like, oh, this word doesn’t sing well.” But, she added, “People who know the play will recognize it.” They did add a chorus and another vocalist, a countertenor who serves intermittently as Orpheus’ double, singing in harmony over the baritone’s vocal line. “When Orpheus is being a normal dude, which he is a lot of the time ... just the baritone sings,” Aucoin said. “But when he goes into his musical trance and that strange superpower takes over, I felt that I needed to musicalize his doubleness, the fact that he’s both human and something else. The countertenor hangs like a kind of halo in those moments.” “For me it brings out the god part of Orpheus but also the androgynous part,” Ruhl said. “When you lose yourself in art, you lose your gender, you’re kind of floating.” The Los Angeles premiere will star soprano Danielle de Niese as Eurydice, baritone Joshua Hopkins as Orpheus (joined at times by countertenor John Holiday), baritone Rod Gilfry as Eurydice’s father and tenor Barry Banks as Hades. The director is Mary Zimmerman. Aucoin himself will conduct the orchestra, which he said is scored for “full strings, a mixture of double and triple winds, full brass, two harps, piano and a lot of percussion doing watery sound effects.” When critics reviewed “Crossing,” they detected influences from several modern composers, including Thomas Ades, with whom Aucoin worked at the Met. “I think a bit of Ades crept into ‘Crossing,’” Aucoin acknowledged. “But he creeps into everybody’s music these days.” With “Eurydice,” Aucoin said, “This is the first piece where I don’t know who the influences are. And I hope that’s a good sign.” With one — possibly surprising — exception: the English rock band Radiohead. “They are very important to me,” he said. “There’s actually a couple of pieces in the opera where I think, `Oh, that’s a chord from a Radiohead song.’”",Associated Press News,"And gave her a call.” Ruhl, who has a long list of plays to her credit but had never worked on an opera, noted that when they began their collaboration, Aucoin was 25, the same age she had been when she wrote “Eurydice.” “The genius and bravery of youth is undaunted,” she said. “But he creeps into everybody’s music these days.” With “Eurydice,” Aucoin said, “This is the first piece where I don’t know who the influences are.

German government defends coal phase-out against critics,https://apnews.com/3d148361d6a2b2e83aa9023c93993229,2020-01-29,"BERLIN (AP) — The German government approved a bill Wednesday that will codify the country’s closure of coal-fired power stations, defending the plan against critics who say it’s not ambitious enough. After signing off on the bill in Cabinet, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier called the plan to phase out the burning of coal by 2038 “a breakthrough” in efforts to combat climate change. Svenja Schulze, Germany’s environment minister, said the next step should be a rapid expansion of renewable energy such solar and wind power. Ottmar Edenhofer, co-director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, welcomed the Cabinet decision, but said the government had made a mistake by pledging large sums to coal plant operators in return for the shutdowns. “They undermine the polluter-pays principle, wherein anyone causing emissions should pay accordingly,” said Edenhofer, who has in the past advised the government on its energy and climate strategy. Utility companies can expect to receive about 4.35 billion euros ($4.8 billion) in the coming years for taking their plants offline. The managing director of Greenpeace Germany, Martin Kaiser, went further in his criticism, calling the bill a “betrayal” of the careful compromise reached last year by a government-appointed expert panel that he was a member of. Kaiser also called on the government to remove administrative and political hurdles to expanding wind and solar power plants, construction of which has slowed significantly over the past year.

Tight security promised for Super Bowl 54 in Miami ,https://apnews.com/133ca79cb81f94c41e664a31cbbbc455,2020-01-29,"MIAMI (AP) — Florida and federal law enforcement agencies preparing for the Super Bowl this Sunday at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens say they are ready for anything, including a detonated bomb or massive food poisoning, but haven’t identified any threats. Events for the 54th Super Bowl, between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers, kicked off Monday around South Florida, with an interactive Super Bowl Experience in Miami Beach and Super Bowl Live at Miami’s Bayfront Park. It’s a lot of mileage to patrol, but officials say they are well prepared. They had been planning for months and running drills. Maj. Ed Caneva, the Miami-Dade Police Department operations commander for the NFL title game, said they identify a raft of different scenarios. “We have been training and addressing anything,” Caneva said. The Super Bowl has long been considered a potential target for terrorists or other violent extremists, and this year the game will be played amid rising tensions with Iran. But none of the games has ever been attacked. Anthony Salisbury, chief of the Homeland Security Investigations office in Miami, said law enforcement agencies nonetheless must be prepared. “It’s all hands on deck,” Salisbury said. “This is a high-profile event. It’s the same with every Super Bowl. Nothing is being taken for granted.” Several thousand federal, state and local law enforcement officials are involved in the game and the events leading up to it. Brian Swain, chief of the Miami Secret Service office and lead federal coordinator for the event, said there’s no intelligence thus far indicating any kind of threat. “There is no specific credible threat right now,” Swain said. “I’m confident in our security plan.” Streets will be blocked off. There will be scores of uniformed police officers and others in plainclothes roaming the stadium to ensure safety. Bomb-sniffing dogs will patrol, and fans must go through metal detectors. The Federal Aviation Administration has imposed flight restrictions over Hard Rock Stadium and around some of the other events. The FAA has even produced a video called “No Drone Zone,” intended to curb the devices around game activities. “Enjoy the Super Bowl. Leave your drone at home,” the video says. Commercial flights at Miami International Airport are unaffected. There has been one potential close call in a past Super Bowl: Five years ago, federal authorities said they encountered a plot in Phoenix by a man who wanted to attack the Super Bowl and an adjacent mall and entertainment district in Glendale, Arizona, with pipe bombs. They said the man, Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, was unable to obtain the explosives, and the game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks was not hit. Kareem later was convicted of conspiring to provide the guns used in an attack on a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest in Texas in which two heavily armed associates were killed by local police officers. He also was convicted of providing support to the Islamic State group. His lawyers asked a judge to grant him a new trial or throw out his convictions. This year’s Super Bowl will be the Miami area’s 11th, the most ever. Hard Rock Stadium is home to the Miami Dolphins and the University of Miami Hurricanes and hosts concerts for major acts including The Rolling Stones. Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said he’s confident the area is ready for this game as well. “We know how to do it,” Gimenez said. “We’ve done this before, and we’re pretty good at it.”",Associated Press News,"There has been one potential close call in a past Super Bowl: Five years ago, federal authorities said they encountered a plot in Phoenix by a man who wanted to attack the Super Bowl and an adjacent mall and entertainment district in Glendale, Arizona, with pipe bombs.

Radha Blank of ‘The 40-Year-Old Version’ isn’t late,https://apnews.com/5c00a8c519f76899ef2777c396bace74,2020-01-29,"PARK CITY, Utah (AP) — The Sundance Film Festival is a showcase of new voices in cinema, and few have come through louder and clearer than Radha Blank’s. Blank wrote, directed and stars in her debut film, “The 40-Year-Old Version.” It’s a heavily autobiographical tale, shot in black-and-white and on 35mm, about a middle-aged playwright in Harlem struggling to fulfill her career’s earlier promise. Faced with unappealing options, like a Harriet Tubman musical put on by white producers, she turns to an old passion, hip-hop, and begins performing as RadhaMUSprime. Blank, who has written for the series “She’s Gotta Have It” (on which she was also a producer) and “Empire,” first began the project as a web series that would have culminated in a mix tape. The death of her mother derailed the series, and Blank later realized “The 40-Year-Old Version” needed a bigger canvas. Lena Waithe (“Master of None,” “Queen & Slim”) came aboard as a producer. In an interview, Blank talked about her film and her Sundance breakthrough. Blank: Honestly, I’m just like appropriating his (expletive). People appropriate black culture all the time. I’m like, “Hey, Judd. I’m comin’ for you!” I think he will have a great sense of humor about it, but I’m totally appropriating his (expletive). I love it when I say ’“40-Year-Old Version” and they go, “That move came out 15 years ago.” And I go, “Nope! V-E-R-S-I-O-N.” But also trying to stay in the spirit of Judd Apatow, black protagonists are quirky and awkward and can’t figure things out and are having identity crises at 40. I would hope one day my films can be in the canon of his storytelling. I lived in L.A. for about three years and even though I look like I might have blended into the cool arts scene, I always felt like Larry David. There are people who look like me who have those odd moments where there are clashes of culture right in front of them. Blank: I was fired from a film job. This is like before I was writing for TV. I got a job. Someone had seen a play of mine and they hired me to adapt a book. And I got fired off the job. And I was kind of devastated and felt a little powerless and just decided, you know what? (Expletive) it. I’m going to make a web series so that I’m in charge. No one can fire me. About two weeks before we were going to shoot the first two episodes, my mom passed away and it pretty much devastated my life. Like we were like Dorothy and Sophia domestically, as a viewer of “The Golden Girls.” We shared the same birthday and she’s the person who nurtured all these storytelling seeds in me. I was probably going to quit anything creative because my biggest champion and friend was now gone. I was going to go back to school and become a social worker. I’m glad I didn’t. I probably saved more children by not becoming a social worker. Blank: It’s me but a heightened version. She is who I wish I could be all the time. She tells it like it is. What we have in common is how we use rejection to fuel an idea. My character, the idea of her becoming a rapper is a joke until she starts rhyming. And for me, when I first decided I wanted to shoot this in black and white. Everyone was like, why would you do that? It’s a matter of trusting your impulses. Blank: “Auteurs” are reserved for older filmmakers. And groundbreaking, fresh films seems to be associated with young filmmakers. I’m somewhere in the middle. I’ve been telling and crafting stories for over 20 years. When it came time to make the film, I knew exactly what it is I wanted to say. For people who know me and know my work, it was just a matter of time before I got here. It’s kind of this idea that we never stop learning about who you are. You can have revelations about yourself and what you should be doing at any age. AP: And that includes rapping for you. But you bring a different perspective to hip-hop. Blank: It’s all of the bravado of hip-hop but it’s from a person whose body is changing. There’s some hot flashes in there. AARP is sending me (expletive) in the mail. I know a lot of people who feel that way, I just don’t see it reflected in mainstream culture. Especially with hip-hop. I love this culture. I am the same age as hip-hop culture. Some of the culture is over-sexualized and over-saturated and so loud. That’s part of why I wanted to film it in black and white. Black and white cools it down. AP: Before Sundance, a lot of the conversation was disappointment in the homogeneity of the filmmakers being celebrated at the Oscars. Blank: I was disappointed but I wasn’t surprised. To me, it fluctuates very much like mainstream culture. Whatever is decided to be the thing is the thing. For one year, the thing was diversity. I don’t know that it is now. When I think about some of the performances I saw in film, like “The Last Black Man in San Francisco” or Adam Sandler. Wait, Adam Sandler doesn’t get it? If Adam Sandler doing his best work isn’t getting acknowledged, then maybe we need to create new platforms of recognition and stop giving the Oscars so much power. It’s kind of like my protagonist. This is about a person who just has to pivot their head and realize there are other kinds of success. It might be time to look in other directions to find that.

Israeli Cabinet postpones vote on West Bank annexation,https://apnews.com/27d373978c683097ca06137bea8ee8b8,2020-01-29,"JERUSALEM (AP) — A senior Israeli minister said on Wednesday that a Cabinet vote to endorse annexation of parts of the West Bank will not take place early next week, despite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s pledge a day earlier to act quickly after the U.S. released a plan to end the conflict that was rejected by the Palestinians. Netanyahu said he would ask the Cabinet to advance the extension of Israeli sovereignty over most Jewish settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley, a move that would likely spark international outrage and complicate the White House’s efforts to build support for the plan. Tourism Minister Yariv Levin told Israel Radio that a Cabinet vote on annexing territories on Sunday was not technically feasible because of various preparations, including “bringing the proposal before the attorney general and letting him consider the matter.” The Palestinians angrily rejected the Trump plan, which largely adopts the Israeli position on all the thorniest issues of the decades-old conflict, from borders and the status of Jerusalem to security measures and the fate of Palestinian refugees. Levin, a senior member of Netanyahu’s Likud party, said the Palestinian state envisioned by the Trump plan is “roughly the same Palestinian Authority that exists today, with authority to manage civil affairs,” but lacking “substantive powers” like border control or a military. The Trump administration had hoped to rally Arab countries around the plan, but so far reactions have been mixed. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, key U.S. allies, welcomed the effort and encouraged negotiations without commenting on the plan itself. Jordan, which has a peace treaty with Israel, has warned against any Israeli “annexation of Palestinian lands,” reaffirming its commitment to an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza with east Jerusalem as its capital. The head of the Arab League said Wednesday that an initial study of the 50-page plan showed that it “ignored legitimate Palestinian rights in the territories.” Ahmed Aboul-Gheit said the Palestinian response would be key in shaping a “collective Arab position” on the plan. “Achieving a just and sustainable peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians depends on the will of both sides,” he said. “The peace plan announced by the U.S. president reflected a non-binding U.S. vision.” The Palestinians seek the West Bank and annexed east Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war, as part of a future independent state. Most of the international community considers Israel’s West Bank settlements illegal under international law. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Jerusalem is “sacred” for Muslims and that any plan that would give “Jerusalem to Israel will never be acceptable.” Erdogan told reporters the measures announced by Trump amounted to a “legalization of Israel’s occupation” of Palestinian territories. “The plan that was announced will not serve peace or a solution,” the state-run Anadolu Agency quoted Erdogan as saying. Hard-line Israeli nationalists have meanwhile called for the immediate annexation of West Bank settlements ahead of the country’s third parliamentary elections in under a year, scheduled for March 2. They have eagerly embraced the part of President Donald Trump’s peace plan that would allow Israel to annex territory but have rejected its call for a Palestinian state in parts of the occupied West Bank. Israeli Defense Minister Naftali Bennett tweeted Wednesday that “that which is postponed to after the elections will never happen.” “If we postpone or reduce the extension of sovereignty (in the West Bank), then the opportunity of the century will turn into the loss of the century,” said Bennett, a hawkish Netanyahu ally with the New Right party. Nahum Barnea, a veteran Israeli columnist, stridently criticized the Trump plan in Wednesday’s Hebrew daily Yedioth Ahronoth, saying it would create a Palestinian state “more meager than Andorra, more fractured than the Virgin Islands.” He cautioned that annexation would lead to “a reality of two legal systems for two populations in the same territory — one ruling, the second occupied. In other words, an Apartheid state.” Associated Press writers Samy Magdy in Cairo and Suzan Fraser in Ankara, Turkey contributed.",Associated Press News,"Tourism Minister Yariv Levin told Israel Radio that a Cabinet vote on annexing territories on Sunday was not technically feasible because of various preparations, including “bringing the proposal before the attorney general and letting him consider the matter.” The Palestinians angrily rejected the Trump plan, which largely adopts the Israeli position on all the thorniest issues of the decades-old conflict, from borders and the status of Jerusalem to security measures and the fate of Palestinian refugees.

"Acclaimed Harvard Scientist Is Arrested, Accused Of Lying About Ties To China",https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/800442646/acclaimed-harvard-scientist-is-arrested-accused-of-lying-about-ties-to-china,2020-01-28,"An FBI affidavit that lays out the case against Charles Lieber includes what federal prosecutors say is a contract between the Harvard researcher and a university in China. Updated at 3:20 p.m. ET Charles Lieber, the chair of Harvard University's Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology, has been arrested and criminally charged with making ""false, fictitious and fraudulent statements"" to the U.S. Defense Department about his ties to a Chinese government program to recruit foreign scientists and researchers. The Justice Department says Lieber, 60, lied about his contact with the Chinese program known as the Thousand Talents Plan, which the U.S. has previously flagged as a serious intelligence concern. He also is accused of lying about about a lucrative contract he signed with China's Wuhan University of Technology. In an affidavit unsealed Tuesday, FBI Special Agent Robert Plumb said Lieber, who led a Harvard research group focusing on nanoscience, had established a research lab at the Wuhan university — apparently unbeknownst to Harvard. In response to the charges against Lieber, Harvard said in a statement to NPR: ""The charges brought by the U.S. government against Professor Lieber are extremely serious. Harvard is cooperating with federal authorities, including the National Institutes of Health, and is initiating its own review of the alleged misconduct. Professor Lieber has been placed on indefinite administrative leave."" The arrangement between Lieber and the Chinese institution spanned ""significant"" periods of time between at least 2012 and 2017, according to the affidavit. It says the deal called for Lieber to be paid up to $50,000 a month, in addition to $150,000 per year ""for living and personal expenses."" ""Lieber was also awarded more than $1.5 million by WUT and the Chinese government to establish a research lab and conduct research at WUT,"" the document states. For a large part of the time frame in question, Lieber was also the principal investigator on at least six U.S. Defense Department research grants, with a cumulative value of more than $8 million, according to the affidavit. It also says he was the principal investigator on more than $10 million in grants funded by the National Institutes of Health. ""These grants require the disclosure of significant foreign financial conflicts of interest, including financial support from foreign governments or foreign entities,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office in Massachusetts said in a statement announcing the charges against Lieber. In interviews with Defense Department investigators in 2018 and 2019, Lieber said that while he had heard of the Thousand Talents Plan, he had never been asked to be part of it, according to the affidavit. Lieber's email correspondence suggests he signed a three-year agreement and employment contract with WUT in 2012. ""Lieber was obligated to work for WUT 'not less than nine months a year' by 'declaring international cooperation projects, cultivating young teachers and Ph.D. students, organizing international conference[s], applying for patents and publishing articles in the name of' WUT,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office said. On its website, the Lieber Research Group at Harvard says its work is meant ""to push scientific boundaries in biology and medicine."" Lieber's work ranged from looking for new ways to produce nanoscale materials to researching areas nanoelectronic sensors and developing ""cyborg tissue"" that would integrate nanoelectronic devices into synthetic tissue. In 2017, Harvard bestowed its highest faculty honor on Lieber, naming him a University Professor – a title he shared with only 25 other faculty members, as The Harvard Gazette reported. But the acclaimed academic is now barred from the university's campus. An arrest warrant for Lieber was issued Monday. The U.S. Attorney's Office case against him initially was sealed after being filed in federal court; a court order lifted that seal Tuesday morning. U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that China's ambitious Thousand Talents program could put a wide range of U.S. scientific interests at risk. ""The worry is that China might be eroding America's technology advantage — not just by support for research, but also by theft of scientific ideas and corporate espionage,"" as NPR's Joe Palca reported in 2018. John Demers, assistant attorney general for national security and head of the Justice Department's China Initiative, said in a statement that the charges against Lieber ""illustrate the serious and persistent threat of China's efforts to steal intellectual property and research from our nation's universities."" He added, ""American universities, while maintaining the open and collaborative research and learning environment that has made them the best in the world, should take this threat seriously and continue to take actions to confront it, including ensuring transparency in their programs' funding sources and their professors' commitments, and having secure physical and internet security for their sensitive research."" The case against Lieber was one of three announced Tuesday by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston that officials say illustrate the threat of Chinese economic espionage. Yanqing Ye, 29, who is currently in China, is charged with one count each of ""visa fraud, making false statements, acting as an agent of a foreign government and conspiracy."" She had been working at Boston University and is accused of lying about her position as a lieutenant in the Chinese military. Zaosong Zheng, 30, was arrested last month at Boston's Logan International Airport and is charged with allegedly attempting to smuggle vials of biological materials and other research materials stolen from U.S labs. Zheng, who was a a Harvard-sponsored cancer researcher, has been indicted on that charge along with a count of making false statements. Lieber earned his doctorate in chemistry from Stanford University in 1985. Before he joined Harvard in 1991, his academic career included stops at the California Institute of Technology and Columbia University.",NPR,"""Lieber was obligated to work for WUT 'not less than nine months a year' by 'declaring international cooperation projects, cultivating young teachers and Ph.D. students, organizing international conference[s], applying for patents and publishing articles in the name of' WUT,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office said.

"Due To New California Law, Uber Allows Some Drivers To Set Their Own Rates",https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/800437791/due-to-new-california-law-uber-allows-some-drivers-to-set-their-own-rates,2020-01-28,"Travelers wait at the ride-share pickup location at Sacramento International Airport. Uber is allowing drivers at three California airports to set their own fares. Uber is testing a new feature in California that allows some drivers to set their own rates. The move comes in response to a new state law that requires more companies to convert their contract workers to employees, which means offering them benefits and added protections. Companies including Uber, Lyft and delivery app Postmates argue that doing so would upend their business model and eliminate the flexibility inherent to the gig economy. Uber is currently testing a feature at airports in Sacramento, Palm Springs and Santa Barbara that allows drivers to increase fares in 10% increments, up to five times the base rate. Riders are then matched with the lowest fare. In the coming days, Uber says it will also allow drivers to decrease their prices below the base rate and opt out of surge pricing. It's part of an effort to give drivers more control — and bolster the argument that they're truly contractors rather than employees. The company acknowledges the experiment could have unexpected consequences. ""It could create more volatility for riders who expect a level of consistency in prices that could change as a result of this,"" said Daniel Danker, head of driver product at Uber. ""And this does add some meaningful complexity to the driver's experience that gives them even more control on how their earnings work."" Nar Bustamante, a traveler at Sacramento International Airport returning from Las Vegas, said he read about the new pricing experiment before landing. ""I think it opens up the road to many misinterpretations between rider and driver,"" he said. ""I don't really know what the normal rate is. It didn't say: 'Here's what the normal rate would be.' So, I'm curious to see where this particular ride ends up."" Drivers in Sacramento appear to be split on the new feature. Adnan Badaoui, who has been driving for Uber for four years, began using it last week. He says even a small rate increase can add up for drivers. ""It's not that much difference my friend, but it makes a difference to us, as a driver,"" he said. But driver Kim Beaver hasn't had much luck. When the feature launched, she set her fare 50% higher than the base rate and waited for an hour without any activity. ""It's just going to be chaos and frustrating for people,"" Beaver said. ""You'll be waiting an hour to two hours to God knows how long."" Gig companies continue to negotiate with state officials, seeking relief from the new labor law that requires companies to convert many contract workers to employees. But Francis J. Mootz III, professor of law at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, says efforts like Uber's new pricing feature may not be enough to convince lawmakers. ""Two or three years ago, if Uber and Lyft and other ride-share companies had really tried to restructure in a way to give workers true independence, true entrepreneurial opportunities, it might've been different,"" Mootz said.",NPR,"""Two or three years ago, if Uber and Lyft and other ride-share companies had really tried to restructure in a way to give workers true independence, true entrepreneurial opportunities, it might've been different,"" Mootz said.

Kobe Bryant's Death Puts A Focus On Helicopter Safety,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/800399644/kobe-bryants-death-puts-a-focus-on-helicopter-safety,2020-01-28,"A helicopter flies in Brazil in 2014. Some helicopter trips — like personal or private helicopter rides — are more likely than others to end in a fatal accident. For the vast majority of Americans, helicopters are hardly a routine form of transportation. But a high-profile helicopter disaster — like the crash in Calabasas, Calif., that killed Kobe Bryant and eight other people on Sunday — can draw widespread attention to helicopter safety. Helicopter rides are significantly riskier than commercial airline flights, but not as dangerous as a trip on a personal plane. And some trips — like personal or private helicopter rides — are far more likely than others to end in a fatal accident. ""I think it is natural to the public, whenever an accident happens, to start to question the overall safety of a certain type of flying,"" says Anthony Brickhouse, a professor of aerospace and occupational safety at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""I would just caution people to be patient and to let the investigation play out so that we can figure out what happened."" Commercial plane travel is extremely safe, despite recent catastrophes like the Boeing 737 Max crashes; in many years the fatal accident rate in the U.S. is zero. Helicopters are more dangerous, according to data from the federal government, with a fatal accident rate of 0.72 per 100,000 flight hours in 2018. But general aviation — like recreational flying — is even more dangerous than that, with a fatal accident rate of more than 1 accident per 100,000 flight hours in 2018. In general, helicopters today are safer than they used to be: Over the past two decades, the fatal accident rate has dropped by half, according to the United States Helicopter Safety Team, or USHST, an alliance of government and industry representatives. But the past few years have seen mixed results. The fatal accident rate rose in 2017 and 2018 before dropping slightly last year. Some helicopter rides are far riskier than others. In the U.S., sightseeing tours, police and news trips, and aerial observation flights tend to be safer than other flights, the USHST says. Corporate flights and ""air taxi"" flights are in the middle of the pack. And personal or private helicopter flights are responsible for a disproportionate number of fatal helicopter accidents. Personal or private rides account for just 3% of flight hours but more than a quarter of fatal accidents. To make helicopter flights safer, the USHST urges changes in training and technology. It also urges pilots to avoid flying too low. The group also highlights the risk of ""get-there-itis,"" when pilots are so determined to arrive at a destination that they ignore signs of risk. In some cases a powerful passenger can also put pressure on a pilot to complete a trip in unsafe conditions, pilots say. Bob Clifford, a lawyer who has worked in aviation litigation for decades, says helicopters offer little margin for error, and when disasters do occur, they are often catastrophic. ""When they work they're wonderful,"" Clifford says. ""Incredible convenience, incredible experience. But the flaws, if there are any in flight, are very fatal."" But Brickhouse, the aerospace professor, says there are a number of ways that helicopter flights can go wrong without ending in disaster. In the event of an engine failure, for instance, a technique called autorotation can bring an aircraft down safely. ""It's not like you have an issue with the helicopter and because it's a helicopter, it's just going to fall out of the sky and everybody's going to perish,"" he says. ""It's really not that simple."" It's an oft-repeated fact that commercial air travel is much safer than driving. That's not necessarily the case for helicopters — but the crash rates for helicopters and cars are calculated differently, so it's hard to make a precise comparison. But one thing is for sure: Americans spend far more time in their cars — some 70 billion hours a year, according to AAA — and as a result, are much more likely to die in a car crash than any other form of transportation.",NPR,"And some trips — like personal or private helicopter rides — are far more likely than others to end in a fatal accident.

Trump Says His Mideast Peace Plan Provides A 'Realistic Two-State Solution',https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/800296507/white-house-to-unveil-mideast-peace-plan-despite-palestinian-rejection,2020-01-28,"Palestinian demonstrators in Rafah, in the southern Gaza strip, hold portraits of President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during a protest against Trump's announcement of a peace plan on Tuesday. Updated at 5:50 p.m. ET President Trump says his long-awaited Mideast peace plan unveiled Tuesday is a road map for a ""realistic two-state solution"" that envisions Jerusalem as Israel's ""undivided capital."" However, the plan limits the sovereignty of a future Palestinian state. Israel would be in charge of maintaining security over the state of Palestine, which would be ""fully demilitarized."" The proposal also allows Israel to declare sovereignty over certain areas of the occupied West Bank, including Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley. Trump heralded the plan as a ""historic breakthrough,"" even though the Palestinian leadership, which severed relations with the U.S. administration as it took a series of pro-Israel moves, rejected it before the proposal was formally released. ""After 70 years of little progress, this could be the last opportunity they ever have,"" Trump said at a joint briefing at the White House with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""My vision presents a win-win opportunity for both sides — a realistic two-state solution that resolves the risk of Palestinian statehood to Israel's security."" The U.S. plan has been in the making since the earliest days of Trump's administration, when the president assigned his senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner the task of trying to forge the elusive deal. Trump lauded his own proposal as far more specific than other peace plans to date. He said it includes a detailed territorial map of the borders showing ""territorial compromises [Israel] is willing to make,"" adding that it marks the first time Israel has authorized the release of such information. He also said the U.S. would open a new embassy in ""Eastern Jerusalem"" to the Palestinians. The Trump administration believes that in addition to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, this plan could lead to a peace agreement that ends the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But Palestinians were outraged by the proposal. Opposition even appeared to unite longtime Palestinian political rivals the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, which governs the Gaza Strip. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas chaired an emergency meeting with Hamas, and called it a ""new phase of Palestinian dialogue and joint work,"" according to local media. Trump has described the plan as the ""deal of the century,"" but Abbas called it the ""smack of the century,"" saying it was an unacceptable attempt to ""liquidate the Palestinian issue."" Hamas leader Ismael Haniyeh said in a statement that ""the new plot against Palestine is doomed to failure and Palestine will vanquish the colonizers at the end."" President Trump (left) and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speak to the media on the West Wing Colonnade ahead of meetings at the White House on Monday. In announcing the plan alongside Trump, with whom he has close ties, Netanyahu said Tuesday that ""I've agreed to negotiate peace with the Palestinians on the basis of your peace plan. It's a great plan for Israel. It's a great plan for peace."" On Monday, Trump met separately with Netanyahu and with Benny Gantz, the leader of Israel's Blue and White political alliance, Netanyahu's principal political opponent. Gantz also has expressed his approval of the plan. Trump said at the time that the Palestinians ""probably won't want [the plan] initially,"" but ""I think in the end they're going to want it."" ""So, we'll see what happens,"" he added. ""Without them, we don't do a deal. And that's OK."" After Trump ordered the U.S. Embassy moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv in December 2017, the Palestinians largely broke off relations with the White House. The move, however, proved extremely popular with Israelis. In June, the White House released the first half of its peace proposal: a $50 billion investment plan billed as a ""new vision"" for the Palestinian territories. The U.S. made the creation of the investment fund contingent upon Palestinian acceptance of the second, political part of the peace plan, released Tuesday. Some analysts questioned the merits of the plan. ""While Trump claims a revolutionary approach to the peace process, this plan actually recycles past failed efforts: it places Palestinians on probation while they prove their worthiness of statehood, using conditions that are malleable and ill-defined; it seeks to induce Palestinian capitulation through economic largesse; and it removes the onus on Israel to make any concessions until Palestinians declare their full surrender,"" Tareq Baconi, Israel/Palestine analyst for International Crisis Group, said in a statement. The proposal comes at a politically fraught moment for both Trump and Netanyahu. Trump is currently on trial in the Senate after he was impeached on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Netanyahu was formally indicted Tuesday on criminal corruption charges. Israel's prime minister ""is trying to make this major diplomatic decision, even though his government is a temporary government, in part to shore up support for him domestically as someone who can champion Israel in the international arena,"" Natan Sachs of the Center for Middle East Policy at The Brookings Institution tells NPR. Sachs also notes that when U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon were facing impeachment, they pushed forward with diplomatic efforts in the Middle East. The plan includes proposals on several core issues that have been major obstacles to progress in previous attempts to forge a comprehensive peace. They include: In April, Netanyahu pledged to annex West Bank settlements in a move aimed at galvanizing support among his right-wing voter base. He later extended that pledge to include annexation of the Jordan Valley, where Palestinians are seeking an independent state. Late last year, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that the U.S. does not view settlements as a violation of international law, upending the decades-old U.S. policy that settlements are an obstacle to peace. Trump said that no Israelis or Palestinians would be uprooted from their homes. According to the plan, Israeli ""enclaves,"" or settlements, ""located inside contiguous Palestinian territory will become part of the State of Israel and be connected through an effective transportation system."" A map included in the plan shows 15 such enclaves. The proposal does not stick to Israel's pre-1967 borders and mutually-agreed-on territory swaps as a starting point for peace negotiations — which had been U.S. policy under President Barack Obama and which Netanyahu described as indefensible. Instead, the plan ""contemplates a Palestinian state that encompasses territory reasonably comparable in size to the territory of the West Bank and Gaza pre-1967."" Israel would annex the entire Jordan Valley, according to the plan. Areas in a future Palestinian state would include parts of the West Bank, connected to the Gaza Strip through a tunnel. It also would include two areas of desert, connected by a thin passage, near Israel's border with Egypt. Israel would not need to wait until before taking control of areas allocated to it under the plan, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said in a call to reporters. Palestinians have long sought their own state, and much of the international community has supported that desire. In 2002, then-President George W. Bush called for a Palestinian state as part of his Road Map for Peace. In 2009, Netanyahu supported a ""demilitarized"" Palestinian state, but by 2015, he had reversed course, declaring his own policy ""null and void."" On Tuesday, Trump said he told Abbas in a letter ""that the territory allocated for his new state will remain open and undeveloped for a period of four years,"" in which Palestinians may deliberate and study the deal and ""achieve the criteria for statehood."" According to the plan, the U.S. and Israel would judge whether Palestinians have met that criteria. Those include implementing a governing system that protects certain rights; establishing ""transparent, independent, and credit-worth financial institutions"";  ending all programs that ""promote hate""; achieving ""civilian and law enforcement control over all of its territory""; and demilitarizing its population. It adds that ""sovereignty is an amorphous concept that has evolved over time."" The limits that the plan would place on Palestinian sovereignty are particularly clear when it comes to security. ""Israel will have the overriding security responsibility and control over the entire territory, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea,"" Friedman told reporters. Even so, the plan expresses ""the aspiration that the Palestinians will be responsible for as much of their internal security as possible."" It also calls for a Palestinian state to be ""fully demilitarized."" And Israel would have the power to expand its internal security role at any time if it deems the Palestinians are not meeting specific criteria, such as possessing certain weapons. Both Israelis and Palestinians view the disputed city of Jerusalem as their capital. When the U.S. moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018, it sparked huge protests by Palestinians. Under the Trump administration's plan, Jerusalem would remain united and would be the capital of Israel. ""We believe that returning to a divided Jerusalem, and in particular having two separate security forces in one of the most sensitive areas on earth, would be a grave mistake,"" the proposal states. It envisions the capital of a Palestinian state in portions of East Jerusalem located beyond existing walls, which Israel says it needs for security, that cut it off from the heart of the city. The plan suggests naming it Al Quds, the Arabic word for Jerusalem. Jerusalem is home to major holy sites for Muslims, Jews and Christians. The status quo for these sites would be preserved, including Jordan's role as custodian of the Muslim sites. Some 750,000 Palestinians were displaced during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. More than seven decades later, Israel denies first-generation Palestinian displaced persons and their descendants the right to return to communities from which they had been expelled or had abandoned. Under the plan, ""there shall be no right of return by, or absorption of, any Palestinian refugee into the State of Israel."" Rather, the refugees would be absorbed into a Palestinian state or integrated into their current host countries. Additionally, up to 50,000 Palestinians may be accepted by Organization of Islamic Cooperation member countries. The proposal also will ""endeavor to raise a fund to provide some compensation to Palestinian refugees,"" without specifying where the money might come from.",NPR,"The Trump administration believes that in addition to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, this plan could lead to a peace agreement that ends the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

'London Calling' At 40: Greil Marcus Revisits His Original Review,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/799345169/london-calling-at-40-greil-marcus-revisits-his-original-review,2020-01-28,"From left to right, Mick Jones, Joe Strummer and Paul Simonon of The Clash, circa 1980. The band's classic album London Calling was released in the United States 40 years ago this month. ""New music from a group said by some critics to be the best rock and roll band in the world: The band's name is The Clash, the record is London Calling."" London Calling stood out from the punk rock of its time: It was political, knowing and clever. Compact disks were still a few years away, so the album's 19 songs spilled over two vinyl disks. ""Rough. Funny. Expansive."" That's how music writer Greil Marcus described the album on our program in 1980, the year it was released in the U.S. He said that London Calling ""takes in many different styles, and yet is always instantly recognizable as The Clash. There's a wonderful sense that life is a struggle, and that the struggle justifies itself; that only when you're in touch with a sense of struggle are you in touch with, let's say, humor, delight, pain, suffering, anger, whatever. It's a very coherent record and it sounds just great."" After 40 years, we asked him back to tell us if he stands by that positive review. Listen in the audio player above, and read on for Greil Marcus' thoughts in his own words. I wouldn't change anything. The Clash, from the beginning, presented themselves as a revolutionary band. Take the most minor provocations or insults or humiliations and make statements about them through their music, pump them up with emotion, and fear, and a sense of jeopardy and a sense of defiance that created songs that made the people listening to them feel bigger, as if they were living in a bigger world where nothing was trivial. This album is just drenched in history. This is a great work; it's bottomless, it doesn't wear out. They could look back and say ""I did something. I was there. It won't be forgotten; the proof is in the vinyl."" They put something in the world that will always be there. When I first heard it in late 1979, my feeling was ""This is just an enormous challenge to the world."" There's a wonderful line at the end of the [titular] song: ""And you know what they said? Well, some of it was true!"" And that sense of ""I've been fighting off paranoia my whole life and now I can't do it anymore because all of these awful fantasies that I've had, that I've heard, they're coming true.""",NPR,"Take the most minor provocations or insults or humiliations and make statements about them through their music, pump them up with emotion, and fear, and a sense of jeopardy and a sense of defiance that created songs that made the people listening to them feel bigger, as if they were living in a bigger world where nothing was trivial.

The trial isn't over, but the core argument in each side's case is clear. The Democratic impeachment managers and President Trump's defense team each had 24 hours over three days to lay out their arguments. (Learn more about the trial process here.) The Democrats charge Trump, who was impeached last month by the House of Representatives, with abusing the power of the presidency and with obstructing Congress — and that his actions merit conviction and removal from office. Trump's lawyers maintain the president's innocence and argue that none of Trump's actions rise to the level of impeachment. On Tuesday the leader of Trump's team, Pat Cipollone, argued that if senators vote to remove Trump from office, they would deny Americans' right to choose their president.

Coronavirus: Australian scientists first to recreate virus outside China - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-51289897,2020-01-28,"Scientists in Australia have become the first to recreate the new coronavirus outside of China in what they have called a ""significant breakthrough"". The discovery will be shared with the World Health Organization (WHO) in the hope it may help efforts to diagnose and treat the virus. Scientists in China have also recreated the virus and shared its genome sequence, but not the virus itself. The outbreak has killed 132 people in China and infected close to 6,000. There are at least 47 cases confirmed in 16 other countries, including in Thailand, France, the US and Australia. No deaths have been reported outside China. Researchers at a specialist lab in Melbourne, Australia, said they were able to grow a copy of the virus from an infected patient. The sample was sent to them last Friday. ""We've planned for an incident like this for many, many years and that's really why we were able to get an answer so quickly,"" said Dr Mike Catton of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. Doctors said the copy could be used as ""control material"" for testing and ""will be a game changer for diagnosis"". That could involve an early-diagnosis test which could detect the virus in people who have not displayed symptoms. Chinese authorities have said the virus - like a normal flu - is able to spread during its incubation period. But the WHO has said it remains unclear whether it is contagious before symptoms appear. ""An antibody test will enable us to retrospectively test suspected patients so we can gather a more accurate picture of how widespread the virus is, and consequently, among other things, the true mortality rate,"" said Dr Catton. ""It will also assist in the assessment of effectiveness of trial vaccines."" According to the WHO, the incubation period can range from two to 10 days. In recent days, the number of virus cases in China has jumped rapidly, despite authorities scrambling to contain its spread.

Kobe Bryant helicopter lacked recommended safety device,https://apnews.com/86ff5b1a17513d79c7a2bbf2e7bc6d0c,2020-01-28,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — The helicopter carrying Kobe Bryant didn’t have a recommended warning system to alert the pilot he was too close to land but it’s not clear it would have averted the crash that killed nine because the pilot may have lost control as the aircraft plunged into a fog-shrouded mountain, federal investigators said Tuesday. Pilot Ara Zobayan had been climbing out of the clouds when the aircraft banked left and began a sudden and terrifying 1,200-foot (366-meter) descent that lasted nearly a minute. “This is a pretty steep descent at high speed,” said Jennifer Homendy of the National Transportation Safety Board. “We know that this was a high-energy impact crash.” The aircraft was intact when it hit the ground, but the impact spread debris over more than 500 feet (150 meters). Remains of the final victims were recovered Tuesday and so far the remains of Bryant, Zobayan and two other passengers have been identified using fingerprints. Determining what caused the crash will take months, but investigators may again recommend that to avoid future crashes helicopters carrying six or more passenger seats be equipped with a Terrain Awareness and Warning System that would have sounded an alarm if the aircraft was in danger of crashing. The agency made that recommendation after a similar helicopter, a Sikorsky S-76A carrying workers to an offshore drilling ship, crashed in the Gulf of Mexico near Galveston, Texas, killing all 10 people on board in 2004. The NTSB concluded if TAWS had been installed, pilots would have been warned in time to prevent hitting the water. The board recommended that the Federal Aviation Administration require the warning systems. Ten years later, the FAA eventually required such systems on air ambulances, but not other helicopters. FAA officials had questioned whether the technology would work on helicopters, which fly lower and could trigger too many false alarms that might detract from safety. The NTSB said FAA’s response was unacceptable, but dropped the matter. While TAWS was not installed on the helicopter flying Bryant, the aircraft did have a warning system using GPS, said pilot Kurt Deetz, who flew Bryant dozens of times in the chopper over a two-year period ending in 2017. NTSB investigator Bill English said they’re looking to document whether there was a GPS-based terrain avoidance system, but said it “doesn’t look to be part of the scenario.” Zobayan, 50, was well-acquainted with the skies over Los Angeles and accustomed to flying Bryant and other celebrities. He had spent thousands of hours ferrying passengers through one of the nation’s busiest air spaces and training students how to fly a helicopter. Friends and colleagues described him as skilled, cool and collected, the very qualities you want in a pilot. Zobayan had flown the day before the crash on a route with the same departure and destination — Orange County to Ventura County. But on Sunday, he had to divert because of heavy fog. His decision to proceed in deteriorating visibility, though, has experts and fellow pilots wondering if he flew beyond the boundaries of good judgment and whether pressure to get his superstar client where he wanted to go played a role in the crash. Jerry Kidrick, a retired Army colonel who flew helicopters in Iraq and now teaches at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona, said there can be pressure to fly VIPs despite poor conditions, a situation he experienced when flying military brass. “The perceived pressure is, ‘Man, if I don’t go, they’re going to find somebody who will fly this thing,’ ” Kidrick said. The chartered Sikorsky S-76B plowed into a cloud-shrouded hillside as the retired NBA star was on his way to a youth basketball basketball tournament in which his daughter Gianna was playing. Two of her teammates also were on the helicopter with parents. NTSB investigators have said Zobayan asked for and received permission from air traffic controllers to proceed in the fog. In his last radio transmission before the helicopter went down, he reported that he was climbing to avoid a cloud layer. Investigators have not faulted his decision. or determined why he made it. The FAA warns helicopter pilots that it is their job to decide whether to cancel a flight because of bad weather or other risks, and to have a backup plan in case weather worsens during the flight. Randy Waldman, a Los Angeles helicopter flight instructor who viewed tracking data of the flight’s path and saw a photo of the dense fog in the area at the time, speculated that Zobayan got disoriented in the clouds, a common danger for pilots. He said Zobayan should have turned around or landed but may have felt the pressure to reach his destination, an occupational hazard for pilots often referred to as “got-to-get-there-itis” or “get-home-itis.” “Somebody who’s a wealthy celebrity who can afford a helicopter to go places, the reason they take the helicopter is so they can get from A to B quickly with no hassle,” Waldman said. “Anybody that flies for a living there’s sort of an inherent pressure to get the job done because if too many times they go, ‘No, I don’t think I can fly, the weather’s getting bad or it’s too windy,’ ... they’re going to lose their job.” Deetz said he often flew Bryant to games at Staples Center, and never remembered the Lakers star or his assistants pressing him to fly in bad weather. “There was never any pressure Kobe put on any pilot to get somewhere — never, never,” Deetz said. Deetz said that he flew with Zobayan a half-dozen times and that he was familiar with airspace and terrain around Los Angeles and knew “the back doors” -- alternative routes in case of trouble, such weather changes. Others who knew Zobayan praised him as unflappable and skilled at the controls. “Helicopters are scary machines, but he really knew what he was doing,” said Gary Johnson, vice president of airplane parts manufacturer Ace Clearwater Enterprises, who had flown with Zobayan about 30 times in roughly eight years. “I wouldn’t do it unless he was the pilot.” Zobayan was chief pilot for the craft’s owner, Island Express Helicopters. He also was a flight instructor, had more than 8,000 hours of flight time and had flown Bryant and other celebrities, including Kylie Jenner. He even had a bit TV part when he and actor Lorenzo Lamas, a fellow pilot, flew the ex-girlfriend of comedian Andy Dick around in a chopper for an episode of “Celebrity Wife Swap.” Island Express has had three previous helicopter crashes since 1985, two of them fatal, according to the NTSB’’s accident database. All involved flights to or from the company’s main destination of Santa Catalina Island, about 20 miles off the Southern California coast. In 2008, three people were killed and three injured when an Island Express helicopter was destroyed as it came in for a landing on the island. Investigators said the chopper lost power, probably as a result of cracking in turbine blades inside the engine. Fatal helicopter accidents have fluctuated between 17 and 30 a year since 2013, according to a safety group that includes representatives of the helicopter industry and the Federal Aviation Administration. The rate of accidents per hours flown has declined slightly over that time. Inclement weather has been cited as a cause of other deadly celebrity helicopter crashes. Grammy-winning blues guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughan was among five people killed in 1990 when their helicopter slammed into a hill in dense fog after leaving a concert in Wisconsin. Music promoter Bill Graham and two others, including the pilot, were killed when the pilot ignored warnings not to fly in rain and fog and flew into power lines outside San Francisco in 1991. On Tuesday, the last of the bodies and the wreckage were recovered from the weekend crash in Calabasas. Fingerprints were used to confirm the identity of Bryant, 41; Zobayan; John Altobelli, 56; and Sarah Chester, 45. While the the coroner has not identified five other victims, relatives and acquaintances have identified them as Bryant’s 13-year-old daughter, Gianna; Sarah Chester’s 13-year-old daughter Payton; Altobelli’s wife, Keri, and daughter, Alyssa; and Christina Mauser, who helped Bryant coach his daughter’s team. Condon reported from New York and Koenig from Dallas.

NPR Seeks 'Clarification' From State Department About Reporter Dropped From Trip,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/800538653/trump-praises-pompeo-after-secretary-of-state-bars-npr-reporter-from-trip,2020-01-28,"""That reporter couldn't have done too good a job on you yesterday,"" President Trump told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Tuesday. He added, ""Think you did a good job on her, actually."" Updated at 8:30 p.m. ET NPR is asking the State Department to explain its decision to deny an NPR reporter press credentials to travel with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on an upcoming trip to Europe, NPR President and CEO John Lansing announced Tuesday. ""We have sought clarification from the State Department regarding Michele Kelemen being dropped"" from the trip, Lansing wrote in an email to employees. He added, ""We have also asked what it means for future trips."" Saying the State Department has not responded to NPR's initial attempts to communicate, Lansing added, ""Our SVP of News Nancy Barnes and I are now sending the attached letter to the State Department demanding answers."" NPR will continue to pursue the issue, Lansing said, adding that access to people in power is fundamental to ""the role of journalism in America."" Last week, Pompeo became upset when questioned about Ukraine by NPR host Mary Louise Kelly. After the interview was cut off, Kelly was called to Pompeo's private living room where he cursed at her and challenged her to find Ukraine on a map. Lansing concluded his note to NPR staff by acknowledging the support the network has received: ""Over the past several days, listeners far and wide have taken the time to write to us with praise for Mary Louise, Michele, and your collective work. They want us to keep going and not give up. I can tell them and all of you, that we are committed to supporting the great journalism and ethical values of NPR News."" The letter laid out NPR's version of events and asked the State Department to explain its justification for barring Kelemen. Earlier Tuesday, President Trump waded into the controversy between Pompeo and NPR, appearing to publicly praise the secretary for berating Kelly and for denying Kelemen's credentials. Kelemen, NPR's diplomacy correspondent, was barred from joining Pompeo's trip, days after he publicly accused Kelly of lying to him about the topic of the interview and the episode following it. Pompeo has said Kelly had agreed to discuss only Iran but has not offered any evidence to support that assertion. Kelly says she confirmed with Pompeo's press secretary that she intended to ask Pompeo about both Iran and Ukraine, a country that is key to Trump's impeachment trial. Kelly has produced emails that reflect those conversations. At a White House event that touted his administration's long-awaited Mideast peace plan, Trump acknowledged the teams that worked on the plan, and his mention of Pompeo's name touched off a prolonged round of applause. After the crowd's ovation, the president smiled as he told Pompeo, ""Wow, that's impressive. That was very impressive, Mike. That reporter couldn't have done too good a job on you yesterday."" As many in his audience laughed, Trump added, ""Think you did a good job on her, actually."" The reference appeared to be about Pompeo's yelling at Kelly and subsequent statement calling her a liar. Some in the crowd then applauded as Trump continued, ""That's good, thank you, Mike. Great."" It was not clear whether the president was referring to Pompeo's interactions with NPR reporters or to the warm applause he received. Kelemen had been slated to cover the secretary's trip as the radio pool reporter, a position that rotates among journalists from different news organizations covering the State Department. After Kelemen was denied a spot on Pompeo's plane, NPR's Lansing said via Twitter on Tuesday morning, ""I stand behind the NPR newsroom, which has some of the most respected, truthful, factual, professional and ethical journalists in the United States."" I stand behind the NPR newsroom, which has some of the most respected, truthful, factual, professional and ethical journalists in the United States.  Our mission is to serve the American public by seeking and reporting the truth. He added, ""Our mission is to serve the American public by seeking and reporting the truth."" The State Department's action against Kelemen prompted a protest from the State Department Correspondents' Association. ""Michele is a consummate professional who has covered the State Department for nearly two decades. We respectfully ask the State Department to reconsider and allow Michele to travel on the plane for this trip,"" said the association's president Shaun Tandon, in a statement on Monday. ""The State Department press corps has a long tradition of accompanying secretaries of state on their travels and we find it unacceptable to punish an individual member of our association,"" Tandon added. Noting that in the past, the State Department has ""courageously defended journalists around the world through statements under its seal,"" Tandon said, ""We are committed to do our part to preserve a respectful, professional relationship with the institution we cover."" The White House Correspondents' Association also issued a statement Tuesday supporting Kelemen and NPR. ""The State Department's apparent attempt to take punitive action against a news outlet for its reporting is outrageous and contrary to American values,"" said the association's president, Jonathan Karl. ""The WHCA calls on the State Department to reverse this ill-conceived decision. We stand with our colleagues at NPR and the State Department Correspondents' Association."" In his contentious interview with NPR on Friday, Pompeo had spoken to Kelly first about Iran before she asked the secretary whether he owes an apology to Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. A Pompeo aide cut off their discussion. The All Things Considered host was then summoned to the secretary's private living room. ""He shouted at me for about the same amount of time as the [9-minute] interview itself had lasted,"" Kelly told her co-host Ari Shapiro. ""He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine. He asked, 'Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?' He used the F-word in that sentence and many others."" Kelly continued, ""He asked if I could find Ukraine on a map; I said yes. He called out for his aides to bring him a map of the world with no writing, no countries marked. I pointed to Ukraine. He put the map away. He said, 'People will hear about this.' "" In email conversations with Pompeo's staff on the eve of the interview, Kelly mentioned two potential topics: While Iran would be a big part of the discussion, she also wanted to talk about Ukraine, Kelly told Pompeo aide Katie Martin, a deputy assistant secretary who has worked in media relations. ""I am indeed just back from Tehran and plan to start there. Also Ukraine,"" Kelly told Martin in a Jan. 23 email. She added, ""I never agree to take anything off the table."" Martin responds, ""Totally understand you want to ask other topics but just hoping we can stick to that topic [Iran] for a healthy portion of the interview."" Kelly then replied in part, ""My plan is to start on Iran and, yes, to spend a healthy portion of the interview there. Iran has been my focus of late as well."" On Saturday, Pompeo issued a statement accusing Kelly of violating ""the basic rules of journalism and decency."" NPR's SVP for news, Barnes, responded to Pompeo's statement by stating, ""Mary Louise Kelly has always conducted herself with the utmost integrity, and we stand behind this report."" In an opinion piece published in The New York Times on Tuesday, Kelly defended her actions in the interview with Pompeo. She wrote that ""people in positions of power — people charged with steering the foreign policy of entire nations — [need to] be held to account."" ""The stakes are too high for their impulses and decisions not to be examined in as thoughtful and rigorous an interview as is possible,"" she said. ""Journalists don't sit down with senior government officials in the service of scoring political points,"" Kelly added. ""We do it in the service of asking tough questions, on behalf of our fellow citizens. And then sharing the answers — or lack thereof — with the world.""",NPR,""" In email conversations with Pompeo's staff on the eve of the interview, Kelly mentioned two potential topics: While Iran would be a big part of the discussion, she also wanted to talk about Ukraine, Kelly told Pompeo aide Katie Martin, a deputy assistant secretary who has worked in media relations.

McConnell: Republicans Do Not Yet Have Votes To Block Witnesses In Impeachment Trial,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/799370839/trump-lawyers-ready-for-final-day-of-presidents-impeachment-defense,2020-01-28,"White House counsel Pat Cipollone speaks during the impeachment trial against President Trump in the Senate on Tuesday. Updated at 7:35 p.m. ET Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a group of Senate Republicans late Tuesday that he does not yet have the votes to stop Democrats from calling witnesses during the impeachment trial of President Trump, according to people familiar with the discussion. But even as McConnell made the concession, the dynamic remains fluid. Whether Democrats' push for witnesses succeeds or fails could come down to a group of moderate Republicans who have remained open, but uncommitted, to new witnesses since the start of the trial. Republicans privately are confident that they can overcome Democratic subpoenas for new witnesses. Democrats need at least four Republicans to cross party lines and support new witnesses in order to meet the threshold for bringing new witnesses and evidence into the trial. Pressure has been building on senators to hear from former National Security Adviser John Bolton, whom Democrats say has a first-hand account of Trump's dealing with Ukraine at the heart of the impeachment case. Bolton, who has a forthcoming book detailing his knowledge of the Ukraine pressure campaign, has said he is willing to share his side of the story with senators. Yet Trump's defense team has fought back, saying Bolton has nothing of value to offer senators, since they argue even if Bolton's account is true, it would not clear the bar of constituting an impeachable offense. Earlier Tuesday, President Trump's defense team completed its arguments  against his removal from office in the Senate impeachment trial. ""I think we've made our case,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone said. ""All you need in this case is the Constitution and your common sense."" He said the two articles of impeachment passed last month by the House of Representatives — abuse of power and obstruction of Congress — ""fall far short of any constitutional standard and they are dangerous,"" a word he repeated several times in final remarks. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said that starting Wednesday at 1 p.m. ET, senators will have a chance to submit written questions to the House impeachment managers and Trump's defense lawyers through U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts, with each party alternating. They will have a total of 16 hours over two days for questions. After the questions wrap up, senators will then take up whether to call witnesses. Tuesday's proceedings concluded against the backdrop of a New York Times report this week that cited the unpublished manuscript of a book being written by former national security adviser John Bolton about, among other things, his time in the Trump White House. Bolton writes, according to the newspaper, that Trump told him that he was withholding military aid to Ukraine until the government there began an investigation into political rivals, including former Vice President Joe Biden's and his son Hunter's activities. That allegation is at the heart of Trump's impeachment. But, in an apparent reference to the manuscript, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow told senators Tuesday that impeachment ""is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts."" Most of the president's lawyers have steered clear of the Bolton report, except for Alan Dershowitz, who argued Monday that even if the former national security adviser's allegations were true, they weren't sufficient to remove a president from office. Still, the news report prompted Democrats to demand that Bolton be called as a witness in the Senate trial. Democrats need to persuade at least four Republicans to defect from their party's leadership in order to support a subpoena of Bolton, a threshold that Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said on Monday appeared ""increasingly likely."" Loading... Some Republicans have floated the idea of a deal on witnesses: one that would include calling Hunter Biden to testify. But before the final day of Trump's defense began, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., dismissed that idea. ""Hunter Biden has nothing to do with the facts of this trial,"" he said at a news conference Tuesday morning. Schumer insisted that senators should hear from the same four witnesses whom he has been pushing for since the start of the trial — Bolton; acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; Robert Blair, a White House official; and Michael Duffey, an official at the Office of Management and Budget. ""We're not bargaining with them — four witnesses and four sets of documents,"" Schumer said. He also dismissed a proposal floated by GOP Sens. James Lankford and Lindsey Graham to allow senators to read Bolton's manuscript in the secure room in the Capitol, a room known as the ""SCIF."" Schumer called this idea ""absurd."" ""It's a book,"" he said. ""There's no need for it to be read in the SCIF unless you want to hide something."" Trump's lawyers, who began their arguments Saturday, had 24 hours over three days to make their case — the same time given to the Democratic House impeachment managers who presented their arguments against the president last week. The House impeachment articles accuse Trump of abuse of power for asking Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals, allegedly using $391 million in vital security assistance to pressure the country into launching the probes. The House articles also charge obstruction of Congress for the White House's refusal to cooperate with impeachment investigators. But on Monday, Trump's defense team offered vastly different version of events, arguing that the president's freezing of military aid was done out of a legitimate concern over corruption in Ukraine, pointing out that the congressionally approved funding was eventually released. Eric Herschmann, another Trump defense lawyer, maintained that the holdup in military aid was not as consequential as Democrats have portrayed it to be. ""It is absurd on its face. Not one American life was in jeopardy or lost by the short delay, and they know it,"" Herschmann said. Ken Starr, who is defending Trump and who led the investigation into President Bill Clinton that triggered Clinton's impeachment, made the case that Trump's impeachment, the third in American history, shows that ""we are living in what aptly can be described as the age of impeachment,"" adding the process is ""filled with acrimony and divides the country like nothing else."" Trump defense lawyer Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, also used Monday to attack the Biden family, playing a television interview with Hunter Biden answering questions about his time as a board member of the energy company Burisma when his father was vice president. Neither Joe Biden nor his son has been accused of any wrongdoing connected to Ukraine and Burisma. Yet Bondi cited news outlets that have covered the Bidens and the energy company before saying: ""They all thought there was cause to raise the issue about the Bidens and Burisma."" Added Bondi: ""The House managers might say, without evidence, that everything we just said has been debunked, that the evidence points entirely and unequivocally in the other direction. That is a distraction."" Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Joe Biden, characterized Bondi's presentation as a ""conspiracy theory"" that has been ""conclusively refuted.""

Trump's lawyers, who began their arguments Saturday, had 24 hours over three days to make their case — the same time given to the Democratic House impeachment managers who presented their arguments against the president last week. Ken Starr, who is defending Trump and who led the investigation into President Bill Clinton that triggered Clinton's impeachment, made the case that Trump's impeachment, the third in American history, shows that ""we are living in what aptly can be described as the age of impeachment,"" adding the process is ""filled with acrimony and divides the country like nothing else."""
"Impeachment Recap: As Defense Rests, Focus Shifts To Witnesses Fight",https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/800568636/impeachment-recap-as-defense-rests-focus-shifts-witnesses-fight,2020-01-28,"President Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow rides an elevator to the Senate chamber for the impeachment trial Tuesday. The admission of new witnesses into President Trump's impeachment trial began to look less likely on Tuesday as defense attorneys and the White House signaled opposition in hopes of persuading Republicans to block them. Lawyer Jay Sekulow called the claims in John Bolton's forthcoming book ""inadmissible"" as he delivered closing arguments and separately, White House aides reportedly began warning senators that a legal fight over witnesses could drag on for months. Democrats have continued the calls they've made all along for new witnesses, including Bolton and others, but it remained unclear whether four Republicans might spurn Trump's wishes and join with all the Democrats to vote to authorize new testimony. The Senate is expected to reach that crossroads on Friday. If the chamber voted to admit witnesses, that would begin a new sub-debate over which ones and under which conditions they might appear. If the chamber does not vote to admit them, it could move onto a vote as to Trump's guilt with respect to the two articles of impeachment. The Republican-controlled chamber is expected to permit Trump to keep his office. Between now and then, senators are scheduled to spend Wednesday and Thursday submitting written questions for the House impeachment managers and Trump's lawyers. So if the door isn't shut to new testimony, it also wasn't clear how the Senate might get from the state of play on Tuesday to a clear picture about the votes within the Republican conference given the increased show of displeasure from Trump's camp. One borderline senators, Republican Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told reporters on Tuesday that discussion was still ongoing about Bolton's testimony. ""We'll figure out how we're going to learn more,"" she said. A close ally of Trump's Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters that he'd had enough of impeachment and that he was contented with the idea of moving on with the evidentiary record as it stands. Graham also said that if Democrats open the door to admitting witnesses, they might not like where that leads. Graham said he was sure there are 51 Republican votes today to call former Vice President Joe Biden, his son Hunter Biden, and other prospective witnesses whom Graham suggested might embarrass Democrats. So be it, riposted Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., later in the day: ""They can call who they want."" The minority leader has ruled out the idea of a partisan trade in which, for example, Republicans would call Hunter Biden if Democrats may call Bolton. Schumer said if there are to be witnesses there must be a full-scale effort to bring in witnesses and their documents and support what he called a real trial for Trump. Schumer wants to hear from Bolton, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and others he says can verify Democrats' allegations in the articles of impeachment. He appealed to Republicans to make that happen. ""All we need is four who rise to the occasion,"" he said. ""Let the chips fall where they may. Get the truth."" The negotiations over witnesses followed even after the end of closing statements by Trump's defense team, which elected not to use several of the hours it still had available under the rules. White House counsel Pat Cipollone said that he and his colleagues considered their case proved and that they did not consider it a difficult problem for senators to unravel. ""All you need in this case is the Constitution and your common sense,"" he said. His summation followed a longer recapitulation by Trump's personal lawyer, Sekulow, which included his declaration that Bolton's evidence was ""inadmissible"" but also the assertion that, even if it were accurate and admitted, it wouldn't matter. Trump's authority over foreign affairs is significant, the lawyers argued, he released military assistance for Ukraine before the expiration of the fiscal year and nothing alleged was illegal or even improper, Sekulow argued. ""There's no violation of the law. There's no violation of the constitution. There's a disagreement over policy decisions,"" he said. That's what elections are for, he argued, like the one this November in which voters must decide whether to reward or punish Trump for his actions — not the Senate, Sekulow argued. If members remove Trump based on the actions in the Ukraine affair, the attorney said, they'll not only spurn voters but also weaken the presidency forever by making every subsequent chief executive subject to what defense lawyers said would be the equivalent of a partisan vote of no confidence, like that used in parliamentary systems. ""Danger!"" Sekulow blared. ""Danger! Danger!"" In the Trump defense team's telling, the Democrats' impeachment case boils down to partisan animus and a disagreement with the president over his foreign policy. ""If that becomes the new normal, future presidents — Democrats and Republicans — will be paralyzed the moment they are elected, before they can even take the oath of office,"" Sekulow said. ""The bar for impeachment cannot be set this low.""",NPR,"So if the door isn't shut to new testimony, it also wasn't clear how the Senate might get from the state of play on Tuesday to a clear picture about the votes within the Republican conference given the increased show of displeasure from Trump's camp.

Americans flown from China virus zone arrive in California,https://apnews.com/e3f13d6f778eae1dd6a062499ed889e7,2020-01-28,"RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) — A plane evacuating 201 Americans from the Chinese city at the center of the virus outbreak arrived Wednesday at a Southern California military base after everyone aboard passed a health screening test in Anchorage, where the aircraft had stopped to refuel. The jet landed shortly after 8 a.m. at March Air Reserve Base about 60 miles (96 kilometers) east of Los Angeles. A ground crew dressed in white approached the aircraft shortly after it landed and three charter-style buses parked near the plane. Federal and local public health officials scheduled a media briefing for later in the morning. All the passengers already underwent two health screenings in China and were screened twice more in Anchorage by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One passenger received medical attention for a minor injury that happened before boarding the airplane in China, Dr. Anne Zink, Alaska’s chief medical officer, told reporters after the plane left. The U.S. government chartered the plane to fly out diplomats from the U.S. Consulate in Wuhan, where the latest coronavirus outbreak started, and other Americans. The plane landed Tuesday night in Anchorage. The Americans will undergo additional health screenings in California and will be temporarily housed as they finish the repatriation process, officials said. Officials have not said how long that housing period will last. “For many of us directly involved in this, it’s become a moving and uplifting experience. The whole plane erupted into cheers when the crew welcomed them back to the United States,” Zink said. “This is the best possible outcome,” state health commissioner Adam Crum said in a statement. “We wish these passengers the best of luck as they complete their journeys home and I am deeply grateful to everyone who came together to assist us in helping with this repatriation effort.” State officials had said the plane could carry up to 240 passengers, and Zink said they were prepared for that number. “At the end of the day, 201 passengers loaded and 201 passengers left Alaska,” she said. The flight crew remained on the upper level of the plane, entirely isolated from the )passengers for the entirety of the flight and did not get off the plane in China, putting them at low risk, she said. The plane is now scheduled to land at March Air Reserve Base in California’s Riverside County, instead of the original plan to go to Ontario International Airport in neighboring San Bernardino County. Curt Hagman, an Ontario airport commissioner, said the Centers for Disease Control announced the diversion. “We were prepared but the State Department decided to switch the flight” to the airbase, Hagman said. Officials at the Ontario airport 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Los Angeles had been readying facilities to receive and screen the repatriates and temporarily house them for up to two weeks — if the CDC determined that is necessary, said David Wert, spokesman for the county of San Bernardino. Ontario International Airport was designated about a decade ago by the U.S. government to receive repatriated Americans in case of an emergency overseas, but it would have been the first time the facility was used for the purpose, Wert said. Wuhan is the epicenter of a new virus that has sickened thousands and killed more than 100 people. China has cut off access to Wuhan and 16 other cities in Hubei province to prevent people from leaving and spreading the virus further. In addition to the United States, countries including Japan and South Korea have also planned evacuations. Symptoms of the virus include fever, cough, and in more severe cases shortness of breath or pneumonia. The Americans aboard the white cargo plane with red and gold stripes left Wuhan before dawn Wednesday, China time. They arrived in Anchorage at the mostly desolate North Terminal just after 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, local time. The jetway was extended from the end of the terminal, but it also had no windows. Passengers were not visible. The passengers were isolated in the airport’s international terminal, which lies mostly dormant in the winter months. The terminal is not connected to the larger and heavily used domestic flights terminal, and each has separate ventilation systems, said Jim Szczesniak, manager of the Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport. “In the wintertime, we have the ability and the luxury of not having any passenger traffic over there, so it’s a perfect area for us to handle this kind of flight,” he said.

Tokushoryu win: Underdog sumo wrestler celebrates unexpected win with tears - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51283431,2020-01-28,"No-one could have predicted the victory of sumo wrestler Tokushoryu - the lowest ranked competitor at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo. But win he did and burst into tears after beating his opponent in a rare public display of emotion. He ended the 15-day contest on Sunday with 14 wins and one defeat. His victory means Tokushoryu is the first bottom-ranked sumo wrestler to win a top-division title since March 2000. The wrestler - who weighs 188kg (414lb) and is 1.81m (5ft9ins) tall - beat his opponent Takakeisho, a champion wrestler, out of the dohyo ring at Tokyo's Ryogoku Kokugikan stadium. After his victory, some spectators described how he was crying one minute, laughing the next. ""I might have cried too much, but at that moment I felt relieved from all the pressure,"" news agency Kyodo quoted the 33-year-old as saying in a post-win interview. ""Deep down I'm feeling like: 'Is it ok for me to win the championship?' I was the lowest-ranking fighter, so I had nothing to fear. I just had to give it everything I had."" After seizing the tournament's lead on Saturday, he said he had recited the sumo mantra to himself: ""I'm not focused on the championship."" He also said the death of his coach - which he learnt of halfway through the tournament - was another thing that spurred him on to victory. He then decided he should win the tournament ""for him"", he said. He had spent 12 of sumo's previous 13 grand tournaments in the second-tier juryo division, Kyodo reports. ""Since the start [of the tournament], I'd been thinking if I give it all I have, that will be plenty,"" he said. ""If I do my best on the opening charge, I can live with the results that follow. I'd done it my way all along, and the final day was the same."" With MEPs set to approve Brexit, the EU Commission president tells the UK: ""We will always love you.""",BBC,"He also said the death of his coach - which he learnt of halfway through the tournament - was another thing that spurred him on to victory.

China coronavirus: Misinformation spreads online about origin and scale - BBC News,https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-51271037,2020-01-28,"More than 100 people have now been killed by the coronavirus. The number of confirmed cases has risen to 4,500 with places like Hong Kong announcing plans to cut travel to mainland China to halt the spread. But not only has the virus spread around China and abroad, so too has misinformation. Numerous conspiracies have appeared since the outbreak - not to mention videos about bat soup. The BBC Monitoring team has been taking a look at where these have all come from. From the very beginning people speculated online about the origin of the coronavirus. This was exacerbated by a slew of videos said to be showing Chinese people eating bats amid the deadly outbreak in Wuhan. One such clip shows a smiling Chinese woman holding a cooked bat on camera, before admitting it tastes ""like chicken meat"". The video prompted outrage online, with some users blaming Chinese eating habits for the outbreak. But the video was not shot in Wuhan, or in China for that matter. Originally filmed in 2016, it shows popular blogger and travel show host Mengyun Wang during a trip to Palau, an archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean. The clip resurfaced on social media after cases of the new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan late last year. Following online backlash, Ms Wang apologised, saying she was ""just trying to introduce the life of local people"" to the audience and had not known that bats could be a virus carrier. Her video has since been taken down. The new coronavirus is believed to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at a seafood market in Wuhan. Although bats have been named in recent research from China as a possible source of the virus, bat soup is not particularly commonplace in the country and the investigations into its exact origins continue. As the United States reported its first case of the coronavirus last week, several patent documents started to circulate on Twitter and Facebook that at first glance appear to suggest experts have been aware of the virus for years. One of the first users to float these allegations was conspiracy theorist and YouTuber Jordan Sather. In a lengthy thread  that has been retweeted thousands of times, he shared a link to a 2015 patent filed by the Pirbright Institute in Surrey, England, that talks about developing a weakened version of coronavirus for potential use as a vaccine to prevent or treat respiratory diseases. The same link has also been widely circulated on Facebook, mainly in conspiracy and anti-vaccination groups. Sather used the fact that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a donor to both Pirbright and vaccine development to suggest that the current outbreak virus has somehow been deliberately manufactured to attract funding for the development of a vaccine. ""And how much funding has the Gates Foundation given to vaccine programs throughout the years? Was the release of this disease planned? Is the media being used to incite fear around it?"" Sather tweeted. But Pirbright's patent is not for the new coronavirus. Instead, it covers the avian infectious bronchitis virus, a member of the wider coronavirus family that infects poultry. As for the speculation about the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Pirbright spokeswoman Teresa Maughan told Buzzfeed News that the institute's particular work with the infectious bronchitis virus was not funded by this foundation. Another baseless claim that has gone viral online suggests the virus was part of China's ""covert biological weapons programme"" and may have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Many accounts pushing the theory cite two widely-shared Washington Times articles both of which quote a former Israeli military intelligence officer for the claim. However, no evidence is provided for the claim in the two articles, and the Israeli source is quoted as saying that ""so far there isn't evidence or indication"" to suggest there was a leak. The two articles have so far been posted to hundreds of different social accounts to a potential audience of millions. The Daily Star published a similar piece last week, claiming the virus might have ""started in a secret lab"". However, it has since amended the piece to add there is no evidence for the claim. Based on official research, the virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. BBC News approached the Washington Times for comment. Another claim inaccurately linked the virus to the suspension of a researcher at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory. Virologist Dr Xiangguo Qiu, her husband and some of her students from China were removed from the lab following a possible ""policy breach,"" according to a report by Canada's national broadcaster CBC last year. Police told CBC News there was ""no threat to public safety"". Another report said Dr Qiu had visited the Wuhan National Biosafety Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences twice a year for two years. A tweet with more than 12,000 retweets and 13,000 likes - claimed without evidence that Dr Qiu and her husband were a ""spy team"", had sent ""pathogens to the Wuhan facility"", and that her husband ""specialised in coronavirus research"". None of the three claims in the tweet can be found in the two CBC reports and the terms ""coronavirus"" and ""spy"" do not appear even once in either. CBC has since reported that these claims are baseless. Different versions of a ""whistleblower"" video, alleged to have been taken by a ""doctor"" or a ""nurse"" in Hubei province, have racked up million views on various social media platforms and mentioned in numerous online reports. The most popular version was uploaded to YouTube by a Korean user, and included English and Korean subtitles - the video has since been taken down. According to the English subtitles, the woman is a nurse in a Wuhan hospital. However, she does not claim to be either a nurse or a doctor in the video at all. This seems to be merely an assumption on the part of those who have uploaded various versions of the video to social media. The woman, who does not identify herself, is wearing protective suit in an unknown location. However, her suit and mask do not match the ones worn by medical staff in Hubei. Due to a lockdown being enforced by the authorities, it is difficult to verify videos from the province. But she makes a number of unsubstantiated claims about the virus, making it unlikely for her to be a nurse or a paramedic. She claims that the actual number of people infected in China is 90,000. But according to official figures, there have been more than 4,500 confirmed infections so far. She also claims the virus has a ""second mutation"", which can infect up to 14 people. But the World Health Organisation has preliminarily estimated the number of infections an individual carrying the virus can cause is 1.4 to 2.5 ""She doesn't sound like someone from [a] medical professional background,"" Muyi Xiao, a Wuhan native and the visuals editor for the ChinaFile online magazine, told the BBC. Although the exact location of the video is unknown, it is likely that the woman is a Hubei resident sharing her personal opinion about the outbreak. ""I think there is [a] possibility that she thinks she is telling the truth. Because no one knows the truth,"" Badiucao, a Chinese political activist currently based in Australia, told the BBC. ""No transparency [has] just left people guessing and panicking."" Have you been affected by any of the issues raised? Are you in Wuhan or have you visited recently?

"Virus in China affects sports events, Olympic qualifiers",https://apnews.com/ca92d5f5ad02c17ea31399b026a91dfa,2020-01-28,"GENEVA (AP) — Amid growing concern about the spread of a new virus in China, international sports in the country have been postponed and Olympic qualifying tournaments have been taken elsewhere. The international ski federation on Wednesday canceled the first World Cup races scheduled for the mountain venue where the sport will be held during the 2022 Beijing Olympics. A men’s downhill had been scheduled for Feb. 15 in Yanqing to start a two-race weekend. “Due to the outbreak and continuing spread of the Novel Coronavirus, FIS, the Chinese Ski Association and its Yanqing Local Organizing Committee, have jointly decided to cancel,” FIS said in a statement. The ski federation said it would advise later if the downhill and super-G races will be be rescheduled. That followed a decision by the international field hockey federation to postpone Pro League games in China. Qualifying tournaments for the Tokyo Olympics in soccer, basketball and boxing scheduled for next month have been moved outside of the country. The biggest upcoming event in China is the Formula One race in Shanghai on April 19, which draws large crowds both for the race and for practice and qualifying. Also under threat is the indoor track and field world championships in Nanjing from  March 13-15 . Olympic qualifying events have been affected in recent days. Women’s soccer and women’s basketball games were moved to Australia and Serbia. The soccer games had already previously moved from Wuhan, at the center of the outbreak, to Nanjing. Boxing tournaments for the Asia and Oceania regions will be held in Jordan in March. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike acknowledged her concern about the virus when speaking Wednesday to the heads of 62 municipalities. “With only 177 days to go and our preparations accelerating, we must firmly tackle the new coronavirus to contain it, or we are going to regret it,” Koike said. ”I will do the utmost to contain this new problem as we cooperate closely with all of you.” Tokyo Olympic organizers put out a generic statement on Wednesday and offered no details. “Countermeasures against infectious diseases constitute an important part of our plans to host a safe and secure games,” the statement said, adding they would “carefully monitor any incidence of infectious diseases and we will review any countermeasures that may be necessary with all relevant organizations.” More than 100 deaths in China have been recorded because of the disease, including the first in Beijing. More than 4,500 cases reported in China include almost 1,000 people in serious condition, national health authorities said. Cases have been reported in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, the United States, Australia, Canada and Germany. The coronavirus family includes the common cold but also more severe illnesses. It causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia. The virus is thought to have spread to people from wild animals sold at a market in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people which is now in lockdown. Future sports events in China also include a World Cup soccer qualifying game on March 26 against Maldives, and the China Open golf tournament, part of the European Tour, on April 23-26 in Shenzhen. Also Wednesday, Danish soccer club Aalborg said it had decided not to play a friendly against Chinese team Wuhan Zall in Spain. “We are aware that the risk of infection may be microscopic, and little is still known about the virus, but in consultation with the (club), management, staff and the health sector, we have agreed not to expose anyone,”  Aalborg managing director Thomas Baelum said.

I Can't Work With You! How Political Fights Leave Workplaces Divided,https://www.npr.org/2020/01/28/798593323/i-cant-work-with-you-how-political-fights-leave-workplaces-divided,2020-01-28,"Amid impeachment and the 2020 election, surveys show political fevers running high at work, undercutting trust and productivity. And workers and employers are bracing for those dynamics to get worse. A few months ago, a skirmish broke out on the factory floor of a clothing maker in Portland, Ore. It had received an order to make T-shirts for the Trump presidential campaign — but some people refused to work on the project. The conscientious objectors were allowed to opt out, says Darcey McAllister, who handles human resources for her small- and medium-size business clients. ""But then those same people were harassing the people who were actually working on the project,"" she says. ""'And so the manager called me and was like, 'What do I do?' "" McAllister told him to remind protesting workers that there was a business to run and to stop heckling their coworkers. On factory floors and work sites and in clusters of cubicles, political divisions are playing out as real-life work drama. Such disputes are not only more common, but they're also more contentious, especially amid an impeachment trial and the lead-up to the November presidential election. According to a recent survey by the Society for Human Resource Management, 42% of U.S. workers have had political disagreements at work. And the resulting strife feeds an undercurrent of workplace stress. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. Employees can't focus, the pace of work slows, and trust is broken. Some workers feel unwelcome or even discriminated against. That's especially true if they're in the political minority in their workplace. Loading... Don't see the graphic above? Click here. ""The people who are Trump supporters probably keep a low profile for fear that they will get verbally attacked or questioned to the point that it would make them feel uncomfortable,"" McAllister says. ""I do absolutely have that sense that that's true in Portland."" What's more, she expects it to get worse: ""I know as we get closer to November 2020, it's going to become more and more of a problem."" That leaves people like Beth Kloetzer in a bind. Kloetzer supervises a Wilmington, Del., library — typically a quiet environment for reading or researching in peace. The 30-person staff is supposed to offer unbiased help finding information. ""We're like Switzerland; you know, we're neutral,"" Kloetzer says. Except that has not been the reality. Personal politics have redrawn allegiances and roiled tensions among staff members. Kloetzer — a Democrat — says, at times, it's difficult to avoid getting sucked into talking about the political events of the day, at work and online. ""Actually, I have a colleague that I just block her on social media because I was like, 'I can't see this,' "" Kloetzer says. She blocks angry posts from her news feed from both sides. Such comments reveal her coworkers' political leanings, which range from conservative Trump supporters to nonsupporters, to liberals and a few in between. ""I wonder sometimes: Do people feel this strongly or is it just that they're driven to feel that way because that's the mood?"" Kloetzer says. It has calmed down a bit recently, she says, perhaps because she has urged her staff to read memoirs written by people on opposing sides, including Hillbilly Elegy, by conservative author J.D. Vance, and Born a Crime, by liberal comedian Trevor Noah. ""Reading about people of different views, you grab hold of the things that you can relate to,"" Kloetzer says. ""It might not change your opinion overall, but it might give you a greater understanding of why everyone doesn't agree."" Some, like Brian Melehan, seek refuge in silence. Politics feels so personal these days he worries a slip of the tongue could cost him business. ""I don't want to make anybody mad; it makes me kind of walk on eggshells,"" he says. Melehan's family runs a residential construction firm in Lisle, Ill. He describes his views as to the left of the Republican-leaning majority in his community. Politics was once safe fodder for chitchat, he says, but now he avoids the subject altogether — especially with clients. That never used to be the case. ""I never, ever felt like I was in fear that my political viewpoint would somehow prevent people from wanting to hire me because they don't like what I think,"" he says. Melehan says he thinks healthy debate is necessary for democracy and hopes tensions will eventually ease. ""Division sells,"" he says. ""It is something that people can get behind for a brief period of time, but eventually we all have to work with each other.""",NPR,"Kloetzer — a Democrat — says, at times, it's difficult to avoid getting sucked into talking about the political events of the day, at work and online.
